        <content type="html" xml:base="https://dtnaylor.com/writing/college-experience/">&lt;p&gt;College, a rite of passage for a majority of young people. Whether this be community college, university, or vocational school, it&#x27;s an experience many of us share.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while we all may share it, everyone&#x27;s college experience is different. Some people find college to be miserable or regretful. Some people find college to be among the best time of their life. Others find it unremarkable. The truth is likely a mix of the three, especially for me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would I label mine? Well, I don&#x27;t feel like I should. Any attempt to put a label on my college experience will be reductive in some way. Saying it was a good time of my life neglects my lows. Saying it was a regretful time of my life neglects my accomplishments. Saying it was &lt;em&gt;just&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; a time of my life neglects the underlying experiences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No group of labels can possibly capture everything. Thus, I feel the best way to share it is to simply tell the story. While a blog certainly will fail to capture everything, I feel as if it&#x27;s one of the best ways to do so. After all,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth... is much too complicated to allow anything but approximations&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-1&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-1&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;preparing-for-college&quot;&gt;Preparing for College&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was in high school, I knew I wanted to attend a prestigious university, ideally in California. My dream was simple: study computer science, and use the prestige of the university to land a software engineering (SWE) role. Specifically, I wanted to work at Google&#x27;s Santa Monica facility on Venice Beach, since I had toured it in 2019 and loved the culture and location. I applied to the following schools&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-2&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-2&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;, all for computer science. My acceptances are emphasized&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yale University&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CalTech&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UC San Diego&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UC Irvine&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UC Los Angeles&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UC Santa Barbara (College of Creative Studies)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cal Poly Pomona&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cal Poly San Luis Obispo&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I applied to UCSB as a double major in math and computer science at the College of Creative Studies, on advice from my father. Ultimately, I was rejected from CCS, and also from computer science, instead being admitted as a mathematics major to the College of Letters &amp;amp; Science.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I was debating between the following three options&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UCSD: Computer Science&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UCI: Computer Science&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UCSB: Mathematics&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone in my position could tell you that UCSD and UCI are no-brainers for my dreams. After all, I &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to study computer science. But my parents really admired CCS, and despite my rejection from it, encouraged me to attend UCSB anyways in hopes of eventually transferring.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I listened to them and attended UCSB. It wouldn&#x27;t be until much later that I realized that my rejection from computer science, and consequently acceptance into mathematics, was divine intervention.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my acceptance, I bid Valencia High School my last farewell, excited to continue my journey in a new place.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-2&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: This list is incomplete, as I do not remember all my acceptances, let alone the schools I applied to.
    &lt;&#x2F;small&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;freshman-year&quot;&gt;Freshman Year&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the most adventurous time of my college experience. But I wouldn&#x27;t say it was the most fun nor enjoyable, as that&#x27;s reserved for my later years.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-new-living-situation&quot;&gt;My New Living Situation&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived onto campus for the first time at around midday, where my parents and I unpacked my belongings and tidied my dorm at Santa Rosa Hall. We spent a few hours together in Santa Barbara eating dinner, until I was finally dropped off at my dorm.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;college-experience&#x2F;freshman_room.webp&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The state of my dorm on an average day in freshman year.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After bidding my parents farewell, the first thing I did was bend my lanyard&#x27;s ring. I unlocked my door, forgetting to remove the key from the lock, and walked forward, causing my lanyard to snag on the ring and bend it slightly. To say I was utterly disappointed with myself would be an understatement, as this is the very first thing I&#x27;ve accomplished upon being given independence. Fortunately, my roommate Jackson was kind enough to lend me some pliers, and I was able to fix it pretty easily.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jackson and I got along very well. Our living habits weren&#x27;t the most compatible, but we were able to work through it together very easily. He was never a major bother for me, and I imagine that I was never a major bother for him. While we didn&#x27;t spend time together outside our dorm, we still talked pretty often and enjoyed each other&#x27;s company. Although our other roommate, whom I will not name, lacked this harmony.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, my unnamed roommate was a recluse, keeping to himself most the time. He was never a major bother socially. His cleanliness was a major bother though. I remember him being in his bed for about 20 hours a day, having never washed his bedsheets a single time during the entire school year. Moreover, he showered incredibly inconsistently. To say our room smelled would be a gross understatement. Jackson and I protested to our roommate several times, all to no avail. Eventually, Jackson got so fed up with this that he frequently bought Febreze Air Fresheners simply to make the room bearable to stay in. Retrospectively, I appreciated Jackson standing up for the things that I was too cowardly to broach.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, it was my unnamed roommate&#x27;s dirtiness that inspired me to remain clean. I made it a crucial point to never allow myself to become as unbearable of a person as he was. I never saw myself as a filthy person, but this experience most certainly strayed me from a path of ever becoming one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from my roommate situation, the dorms were okay. The central location was a major bonus, as well as the proximity of all my friends. Being able to run into people and make plans on a whim is an unforgettable experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;college-experience&#x2F;santa_rosa_sky.webp&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The location was gorgeous too!&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there were two parts of the dorms I could never get over.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communal kitchen&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communal bathrooms&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both were disgusting. I vowed to get out of the dorms as soon as I could, since I largely saw the dorms as a hub of filth.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-new-social-life&quot;&gt;My New Social Life&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first goal was to make friends, as all my friends from high school went to different universities. So I signed up for a lot of clubs: Math Club, Pacific Math Alliance, Data Science UCSB, Video Game Development Club, Gaucho Gaming, you name it. If there was ever an event open to all, there was a solid chance I was present.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;The state of a very intense Jenga match. Easily one of the most memorable nights that year.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;college-experience&#x2F;denzel.webp&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;I volunteered for a concert and got to shake Denzel Curry&#x27;s hand :)&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up making friends at a Ki Aikido Martial Arts class hosted by the recreation center.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did I sign up for Ki Aikido, of all things? I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell you. I think the underlying philosophy of harmony, calmness, and redirecting aggressive energy deeply resonated with me. Embarrassingly, I showed up 40 minutes late to the first lesson. Not because I was legitimately late, but because I couldn&#x27;t find the room it was being hosted in.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I made three great friends in Aikido: Antonia, Jessica, and Josephine. They became my primary friend group, in which we dubbed ourselves the &quot;Saturday Crew&quot; since we always hung out on Saturday.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, Josephine and I were neighbors, as we lived in adjacent halls to one another. So we hung out very often, getting dinner together very frequently, typically on a whim. She was easily one of my greatest friends that year, and someone I felt comfortable talking to about anything.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;academic-ambitions&quot;&gt;Academic Ambitions&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ending the social diversion here, I would like to return to the goals my high school self set.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transfer into CCS Computing&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain enough experience to work as a SWE at a big tech company, ideally Google&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make myself &quot;competitive&quot;, I figured I should do a double major in mathematics and computer science. So I contacted the CCS Math and Computing faculty about a transfer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They responded essentially saying &quot;sorry, our freshman class is too big, so we cannot accept any more students&quot;. Naturally, I was devastated, as my goals had essentially disappeared right in front of my eyes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most brutal part of all this? The Santa Rosa dormitory is positioned right next to the College of Creative Studies building. Every day, I had to walk by that building, knowing I failed to not only get in initially, but also was unable to transfer into it. To say my self-esteemed worsened would be a terrible minimization of how I felt.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was just about ready to accept my fate. But one day, I went to an event hosted by Data Science UCSB. It was essentially a party on the oceanside balconies. At this event, I ran into a CCS Math senior. We talked for a while about all sorts of things, until I eventually mentioned everything I had written here. How I tried to apply to CCS, was rejected, tried to transfer, and rejected again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His response was along the lines of&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, try again. I was in a similar position as you, having transferred in my freshman year. What worked for me is I took a few CCS courses, and they liked me enough to let me in. You should do the same. Reach out to the other advisor&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-3&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-3&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; Karel. Maybe you can take some of his courses.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;college-experience&#x2F;freshman_ambition.webp&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;While that night was cloudy, it had a certain clarity to it.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know, he was right. It&#x27;s easy to say no to an email, but hard to say no to a face. Especially when that face is tied to demonstrated experience. I emailed Karel requesting exactly this: I want to transfer into CCS Math, and I would like to take a few courses to &quot;prove my worth&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He responded to my email positively, and after some back-and-forth, he essentially said&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-4&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-4&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;4&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He will allow me to take one course in winter quarter.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I do well, he will allow me to take two additional courses in spring quarter.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is my responsibility to learn the prerequisites for these courses.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agreed, and spent all winter break catching myself up to speed. I asked one of my professors for material suggestions, in which he granted me access to an old course containing pre-recorded lectures. As a result, I put my computing ambitions on pause and focused solely on math.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was all very risky, as nothing was guaranteed, but I knew this was a step in the right direction. After all, I took the risk of coming to UCSB over comfortable options at UCSD and UCI, so it would be quite dumb to squander it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to taking these courses, I was used to being at the top of the class, with everything coming very easily to me. This was especially true for the first few courses I took at UCSB. So being placed into a room full of significant prowess, far exceeding my own, where we&#x27;re all learning material that took hours to digest, was incredibly humbling.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part though? My classmates never judged me, nor saw me as inferior. I was treated as one of their own, as if I&#x27;d been a CCS Math student all along. As a result, my perspective on learning and the world changed substantially. The value of prestige and being &quot;the best&quot; now meant nothing, and I instead focused on learning. Because well, at a certain point, &quot;the best&quot; doesn&#x27;t make any sense.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, as much as I struggled, I did well in all of these courses, and Karel respected me greatly&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-5&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-5&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;5&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;. In the midst of spring quarter, my transfer application into CCS Math was approved, and I was finally in CCS. Rather than walking by the CCS building every day with feelings of doubt and shame, I can walk by it with a newfound sense of pride and accomplishment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-3&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: As of writing, CCS has two math advisors. He told me to speak with the advisor I hadn&#x27;t interacted with yet.

The &quot;prerequisites&quot; were discrete mathematics.
    &lt;&#x2F;small&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-5&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: At the end of my sophomore year, he told me (paraphrasing): &quot;Wow, you&#x27;re moving onto bigger classes and won&#x27;t take any of mine anymore. I&#x27;ll miss you and the energy you brought, I really liked it&quot;. Was very difficult for me to not cry right there and then.
    &lt;&#x2F;small&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-summer-of-doubt&quot;&gt;A Summer of Doubt&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having successfully transferred into CCS Math, my next goal was to double major in CCS Computing. However, my experiences during this summer sowed a seed of doubt that culminated with dropping this ambition altogether.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any freshman trying to break into tech, I was trying to find an internship. I learned the hard way that many companies don&#x27;t like hiring freshmen, so it&#x27;s incredibly competitive, and unlikely as someone who wasn&#x27;t in a tech major. However, through Data Science UCSB, I got involved with an informal project that sufficed my desires.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was essentially the upgrading, development, and maintenance of a Discord bot serving the UCSB general server. The purpose of the project was to equip club members with skills needed for pivoting to SWE roles. It was very small in scope, but despite this, there was an interviewing process&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-6&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-6&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;6&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;, so it felt fairly formal.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be completely honest, I was surprised that I was chosen for the role. Perhaps I perfectly matched the background of a non-CS major trying to pivot into CS. Nevertheless, that summer I devoted about 4–6 hours a week working on it, while also working as a tutor on the side.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;college-experience&#x2F;discord_menu.webp&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;One of the features was to incorporate the menus of each dining hall into the bot.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I didn&#x27;t &lt;em&gt;dislike&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; the project, I didn&#x27;t find it that interesting either. As I was working, I realized that this is the type of work I was trying to pivot into. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I don&#x27;t think SWE is inferior work or lacks interesting aspects in its own right, I just simply did not find it that fulfilling to do. Frankly, doing this kind of work for the rest of my life would leave me miserable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#x27;t articulate that last point until a bit later into my college experience, but the seeds of doubt were sowed. Ironically, the project leader for this Discord bot intended to offer us an experience that would help us break &lt;em&gt;into&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; computer science. However, he did the exact opposite for me, as it was this experience that broke me &lt;em&gt;out of&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-6&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;6&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: The reason why was because the leader of the project wanted to keep it small in scope, at 3 new people, amidst 10–15 members expressing interest.
    &lt;&#x2F;small&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;sophomore-year&quot;&gt;Sophomore Year&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sophomore year was by far the most depressing time of my life. It&#x27;s unsurprising that I don&#x27;t have many pictures from this time period as a result.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, I also treated it as the least remarkable. But that&#x27;s not really a fair thing to say. After all, it was precisely during sophomore year that I not only managed to develop foundations, academically and socially, that would carry me very far, but also point myself in the right direction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-not-so-new-living-situation&quot;&gt;My Not-So-New Living Situation&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn&#x27;t managed to find an apartment for my sophomore year, so I was still in the dorms. Frustratingly, my room assignment was not only in the same building, it changed only by 1 number. I went from Room 1141 to Room 2141. A part of me was disappointed, since my living situation was more or less the same, offering no new experiences in an otherwise adventurous time of my life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my roommates this time around were amazing. We all got along very well and enjoyed each other&#x27;s company. The quality of the room was certainly much better, and I deeply appreciate them for it. While we didn&#x27;t hang out very often, we still interact with each other to this day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Everyday, I wrote a joke on our front door.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much more is to be said, as my living situation was otherwise identical. I still yearned for the days I would have my own kitchen and bathroom.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-newer-social-life&quot;&gt;My Newer Social Life&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they say, all good things must come to an end. The Saturday Crew, my primary freshman year friend group, was falling a part&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jessica transferred to a different school.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Antonia, while keeping in touch with us, branched off into other things.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of those two, Josephine and I stayed in touch for much of our freshman year, even the following summer. At some points we would even talk with each other daily. But alas, we drifted a part during fall quarter of sophomore year. She was in an entirely different major than I, so our classes began to diverge. At some point, I probably began to annoy and outright frustrate her, as I certainly wasn&#x27;t the most mature nor respectful person towards her. Eventually, at the end of the quarter, we parted our separate ways from each other. Aside from one brief interaction a few months later, we have not spoken since.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the collapsing of my friend group, as well as parting ways with one of my closest friends, left me very depressed. One of my biggest failures during freshman year was acquiring many friends. Outside the Saturday Crew, I didn&#x27;t really interact with people that intimately. So I made it an especially important point to develop a stronger foundation of friends.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One friend, Kavi, helped me greatly during my period of depression. I don&#x27;t quite remember exactly how we met and started interacting, though I remember it was in the midst of my depression. I was a pretty terrible friend to her, as I frequently bailed on her or made little effort to interact with her. And yet, she still talked with me. We haven&#x27;t spoken with each other in a long time, but I sincerely hope she&#x27;s doing well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What especially helped, however, was forming a new friend group with my future roommates. Oddly enough, I befriended two cliques of them separately, both at the Tabletop Gaming Club. Eventually, they realized that they all knew who I was, and invited me to the broader friend group.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;college-experience&#x2F;mahjong.webp&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;They taught me how to play Riichi Mahjong. I&#x27;m not good at it, but it&#x27;s very fun.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Hanging out in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, with my newfound friends.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, now being an official CCS major, I began hanging out with my peers. I signed up for a Directed Reading Program through the Math department, and bonded with my friend Pariya. Our project wasn&#x27;t anything major, focusing on old-school neural networks (namely, Hopfield Models). It was a good experience to not only expose myself to math, but also work with other people. Although, I don&#x27;t think Pariya liked the project much, if at all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;renewed-academic-ambitions&quot;&gt;Renewed Academic Ambitions&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digesting my summer Discord project, as well as subsequent interactions with computer science in general, led me to conclude that I would be miserable as a CS major. My DRP project with Pariya was especially insightful as I realized that technology was not locked behind computer science, and in fact was far more interesting under a lens of mathematics.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;college-experience&#x2F;drp_poster.webp&quot; style=&quot;width: 75%;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Pariya and I presenting our DRP poster.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I was dejected as I went through realizing how wrong and off-the-mark my high school ambitions were. The goals I had been holding since sophomore year of high school are now unattainable, not because I physically couldn&#x27;t accomplish them, but because I would be miserable doing so. I wasn&#x27;t feeling chagrin, but rather a loss of purpose. After all, my ultimate college goal was to eventually become a SWE, so now what do I work towards?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t have an answer for this question until junior year. Until then, my strategy was simple: focus on getting the core requirements of my major out of the way, and explore outside the classroom. This led to my greater involvement with Data Science UCSB, and my friend Sam (not my roommate), an officer of the club.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was more involved than freshman year, I still wasn&#x27;t very active in Data Science UCSB as a club member, attending some social events or small workshops and not much more. At the end of the year though, they were recruiting for officer positions. Originally, I wasn&#x27;t planning to apply, as I felt like I wasn&#x27;t qualified nor belonged. But Sam encouraged me to apply to the &quot;Beginner Pipeline Director&quot;. The gist of the role is I would teach Python, Python packages, and other data science fundamentals to club members. While I had little exposure to data science at this point, the role was simple enough that I qualified for it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After applying, I was selected for an interview. The interview went really well&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-7&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-7&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;7&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;, although I later learned that the then-President left a note saying &quot;friendly and personable, but a bit boring&quot;. Ouch. Nevertheless, they accepted me, and I was happy as I felt like I was heading down the right direction. Upon arrival to Data Science UCSB, the technical team was as follows&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beginner Pipeline: Daniel (me)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intermediate Pipeline: Mitali&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project Pipeline: Tanay, Mehir&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all got along very well, with Tanay, Mitali, and I referring to ourselves as the dream team, and Mehir serving as our leader. How little did I know that this decision was one of the most transformative decisions I&#x27;ve ever made, and is where I attribute all of my following success.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p 
    id=&#x27;footnote-body-7&#x27; 
    class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote_body&#x27;
&gt;
    &lt;small&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-7&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;7&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: The interview, led by Mehir, had a surprise technical question. &quot;Given a string of words separated by whitespace, produce a list of the unique words.&quot; My solution was to split the string into a list, convert it to a hash table, then back into a list. The intended solution involved regex, but they accepted mine anyways. I later learned that, out of all the people they interviewed (15–20), including for more advanced roles, only 3 people figured it out, which were myself, Tanay, and Mitali.
    &lt;&#x2F;small&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-summer-of-development&quot;&gt;A Summer of Development&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very first meeting with my technical colleagues at Data Science UCSB, we agreed on one thing: we need to abolish the pipelines. Essentially, the pipelines were club-curated courses into a particular subject, with weekly lectures and recommended &quot;take-home&quot; assignments. They received little attendance, were poor in structure, and too demanding on our club members. We spent the entire meeting discussing alternatives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we came up with the following plan.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All technical officers are now &quot;Directors of Technical Development&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pipeline meetings are to be replaced with workshops, essentially à la carte lessons in data science.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project groups through the club are required to attend weekly &quot;check-ins&quot; wherein we assess progress every week. Three absences disqualifies a project group.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical officers are responsible for mentoring projects and hosting workshops.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which frightened me, since I was originally brought onto the club to teach Python, and am suddenly held to the standard of guiding advanced data science projects. Keep in mind that at this point, I had almost exclusively taken theoretical math courses, such as real analysis, complex analysis, numerical analysis, and linear algebra. So my knowledge of data science was largely nonexistent. However, I knew it would be wrong of me to object to the plan, since this design was best for the club as a whole. As a result, I spent that entire summer catching myself up to speed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did this look like? Developing workshop material&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-8&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-8&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;8&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;. We partitioned workshop topics among ourselves and spent most of the summer building them from scratch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, my math background was incredibly handy, as it became exceptionally useful for understanding everything. At first, I paid little attention to this detail, dismissing it as coincidence. But I would eventually come to realize, and appreciate, just how far a math background can take you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p 
    id=&#x27;footnote-body-8&#x27; 
    class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote_body&#x27;
&gt;
    &lt;small&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-8&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;8&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: I wouldn&#x27;t realize this until post-graduation, but I essentially employed Feynman&#x27;s technique for all my learning.
    &lt;&#x2F;small&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;junior-year&quot;&gt;Junior Year&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most pivotal year that holds the crowned jewels of my accomplishments. Junior year was truly a test of commitment, patience, time management, and adaptability. By and large, it was the year in which I transformed the most.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-new-sense-of-purpose&quot;&gt;A New Sense of Purpose&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon junior year&#x27;s beginning, I was rather nervous. My background in data science was fairly minimal, and we were beginning to execute our plans for the DS club. Moreover, I was taking several graduate courses across the math and PSTAT (Probability &amp;amp; Statistics) departments. Furthermore, I was working as a tutor for the university. I intended to maintain all these commitments, so I fully expected everything to be difficult.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, almost as soon as the quarter started, our technical leader Mehir resigned from the club to pursue other interests. This left Tanay, Mitali, and I in an awkward situation, as we are now carrying out a plan without a clear leader, and with one less contributor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;college-experience&#x2F;ds_meeting.webp&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;A general officer meeting at Data Science UCSB.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, all 3 of us got along very well, and quickly identified our niches. We understood all our strengths and shortcomings, and redirected curious club members to the appropriate officer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, hosting workshops and mentoring projects wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as I thought. My course knowledge, summer experience, and especially math background proved incredibly useful. The nice thing about teaching is you understand the material far better and identify your misconceptions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I hadn&#x27;t realized until much later was how much overlap, and consequentially personal development, my data science experience had with my tutoring experience. It essentially became a positive feedback loop: the tutoring experience improved my explanations, which improved my ability to mentor, which improved my ability to host group sessions, which improved my public speaking abilities, etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while Data Science UCSB did a good job at exposing myself to new ideas, it wouldn&#x27;t be until I took PSTAT 215A, Bayesian Statistics with Dr. Alexander Franks, that I would find my new purpose. The class was amazing, both in terms of the way it was taught and the material itself. It was at that moment I finally understood where exactly my interests lie.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-ascending-social-life&quot;&gt;An Ascending Social Life&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having my own apartment immensely improved my well-being. Aside from finally having my own kitchen and bathroom, I was in an environment constantly surrounded by friends. My prior roommates Jackson, Bryar, and Sam were all great, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but I never bonded with them as friends like I did with my roommates.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was especially nice to be able to cook meals and share it with everyone. I grew quite fond of cooking while I was in the apartment, as it served as a pleasant way to pass time while I had nothing else to do.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside my roommates, I bonded incredibly well with the board members of Data Science UCSB. Seeing everyone regularly was very nice, especially Tanay and Mitali. We had to work closely together since much of our work was entirely experimental, constantly needing reassessment and modifications.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly, I made great friends at tabletop gaming club, beyond my roommates. We hung out fairly often, typically around twice a week.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;college-experience&#x2F;junior_friends.webp&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Playing &lt;i&gt;Muffin Time&lt;&#x2F;i&gt; with my friends at tabletop.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My social network rapidly expanded. Going from very few friends in freshman and early sophomore year to several different friend groups brought me a lot of happiness. I enjoyed talking with everyone, and it was a great way to keep myself occupied.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-summer-of-research&quot;&gt;A Summer of Research&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the graduation requirements for CCS was to engage in some form of research. Originally, I was getting involved with a few of an unnamed professor&#x27;s projects. However, I thought long and hard about it, and ultimately dropped those commitments once I realized I wouldn&#x27;t enjoy those projects.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I worked on a project with Franks. Going into detail will require a blog post in and of itself, but the gist of the project is we wanted to propose alternative ways to quantify the skill of NBA basketball players. Our idea was to use the tools of causal inference, and try to determine the &quot;causal effect&quot; of each player on point differentials.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we weren&#x27;t able to achieve our goal&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-9&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-9&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;9&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;, I learned immensely from this project. Although, I held myself to a ridiculously high standard, always fearing I was disappointing Franks. I learned the hard way just how much disconnect there is between graduate courses and real-world projects at the same level. As much as I may have panicked and potentially stressed him out, I think we bonded well during it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p 
    id=&#x27;footnote-body-9&#x27; 
    class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote_body&#x27;
&gt;
    &lt;small&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-9&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;9&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: The bottleneck of the project was evaluation. We couldn&#x27;t figure out a good way to benchmark our metrics with the industry standard&#x27;s metrics, since they were fundamentally very different for our target audience. For ad hoc evaluations, we used RMSE, in which the null model that predicts 0 skill for everyone performed the best.
    &lt;&#x2F;small&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;senior-year&quot;&gt;Senior Year&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most satisfying year, defined mainly by balancing commitments and stress, followed by relaxation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-perils-of-commitment&quot;&gt;The Perils of Commitment&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first quarter of senior year was the most stressful quarter of my entire college, rivaled only by my first quarter of junior year.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Four reasons&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I took on the role of &quot;Internal Vice President&quot; for Data Science UCSB, which led the technical wing. It was much more demanding than I had anticipated.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I should note that, while a new executive role, no autonomy was lost among any of the technical officers.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also were re-evaluating many of our ideas in the year prior, though fortunately we had a larger team which made it more manageable.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I decided to enroll into PSTAT 223A, despite not taking its prerequisites PSTAT 213BC.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact, I was enrolled in 3 graduate courses.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was applying to grad school.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I continued to work as a CLAS tutor.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding our ideas in Data Science UCSB was challenging. We agreed that, while the previous year&#x27;s systems were a step in the right direction, it was far from perfect. Our primary point of contention was the role of workshops, as we felt it resembled lectures too much while resembling projects too little. We made it a point to reassess them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;college-experience&#x2F;tech_dev.webp&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The Directors of Technical Development at one of our last events.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As difficult as contributing to the club may have been, it pales in comparison to my courses. PSTAT 223A, stochastic calculus, was by far the most difficult class I have ever taken. However, it was also one of the most interesting, rivaled only by PSTAT 215A with Franks. The professor, Dr. Jean-Pierre Fouque, whom I will refer to as JP, was easily one of my best professors. Aside from explaining the subject very well, JP structured the class very interestingly. It opened my eyes to mathematical modeling. JP is a major name in mathematical finance, a field deeply rooted with the material, so he was easily one of the best professors to teach it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pile onto my stress, grad school applications hit me hard. While I spent some of the summer coming up with decent generic application material, the tricky part was finding schools and, more importantly, identifying professors who matched my interests. At the time (and as of writing), my interests were incredibly broad, and having only 1 year of experience up until this point, also fairly vague. I did not want to add another stressor of the GRE, so I was forced to filter out many programs that interested me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retrospectively, while my generic application was solid, my effort at tailoring the applications towards the individual schools left much room for improvement. Moreover, I should have reached out to professors during the summer about potential interests. But pondering over these concerns is fruitless, since UC Irvine was my top choice to begin with, the school I ultimately ended up at.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-homestretch&quot;&gt;The Homestretch&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my fall quarter ended, things calmed down substantially. And for those last six months of undergrad, I felt great solace. All my stressors and worries had passed, and now I was just focusing on the things that interested me, academically and socially, until I graduated. Of course, I was worried about my future, and if I would even get into grad school. But I was happy knowing that all that&#x27;s left is to make the most out of college.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;college-experience&#x2F;admission_party.webp&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Despite my worries, I ended up getting into my top choice. Yibo (left of me from camera&#x27;s POV) and I celebrated our acceptance with our friends at KBBQ. Now, there was nothing left to worry about.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My social life was at an all-time high, as my roommates and I moved to a newer (and more spacious) apartment. The living room was especially nice, as it made hanging out very easy. Every Wednesday night I invited my friends to play games together. Why Wednesday? It was the only time that worked for us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;college-experience&#x2F;apartment_muffin_time.webp&quot; style=&quot;width: 75%;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Playing with my friends in the apartment. We played all sorts of things, primarily &lt;i&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;&#x2F;i&gt;, though this time we decided on &lt;i&gt;Muffin Time&lt;&#x2F;i&gt; (again).&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those six months felt like a bliss. In many ways, things were going incredibly well&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-10&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-10&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;10&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;. All my worries of falling behind disappeared entirely. &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ucsb.edu&#x2F;2025&#x2F;021894&#x2F;ucsb-math-graduate-charts-his-next-move&quot;&gt;The university even wrote an article about me.&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; Most of my courses were exclusively ones I wanted to take, except for introductory physics (PHYS 7A). My involvement, both in extracurriculars and social activities, was prolific. At last, everything I did was for myself, and myself only.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

He asked if I could be a grader for his optimization class, Math 132A. I was happy to be invited, and accepted the offer. Upon the start of spring quarter, the Math Department reached out to me and asked if I would be willing to grade for Math 132B. The offer left me feeling very excited knowing I did a good job in their eyes.

&lt;p&gt;But alas, six months is not a very long time, and it ended just as quickly as it started. On June 8th, 2025, I finally graduated&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-11&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-11&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;11&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; from UCSB, with a major in mathematics and a minor in statistical sciences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frustratingly, we graduated on the weekend in between Week 10 and finals week, so we were still required to do finals. While I wasn&#x27;t worried about any of them, to say I was irked would be a grand understatement.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last time on campus&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-12&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-12&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;12&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; was Friday, June 13th, 2025. One of my courses didn&#x27;t have a final exam, instead a final homework assignment the professor requested to be turned in on paper. I entered his office, chatted with him briefly, and bid him farewell and a good summer. This was my last moment as an undergrad, and I felt bittersweet. I decided to reward myself by going to the nearby snack shop, The Arbor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;I was left with a pleasant surprise upon sitting down.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just as my luck would have it, I got gum stuck to my pants as soon as I sat down. And you know, it reminded me of how I began college, by bending my lanyard&#x27;s ring. A mix of both obliviousness and misfortune. I guess some things never change, do they?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, I bid my final farewell to UCSB, excited to begin a new journey at UCI.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;h1 id=&quot;closing-remarks&quot;&gt;Closing Remarks&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To all that have read this far, I appreciate it. Keep in mind that there are many experiences and events I was unable to mention. This is merely an approximation, not a proper retelling, of my college experience. Doing so would require me to verbally tell the story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone reading this blog for advice, there are a few key takeaways I want to highlight.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no &quot;proper&quot; college experience. If you ask anyone else to retell theirs, it will be dramatically different from mine. Worry not about doing what other people consider right, but what you consider worthy.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The worst thing you can do is use this blog as a template for your own experiences. Don&#x27;t do that. You will be missing out on the whole point of independence.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are several themes throughout this blog, namely perseverance, determination, and most notably, luck. It&#x27;s easy to conclude that, while I was a hard worker, my success is a product of luck in my early formative years. This is a good point, but also one that neglects one crucial fact: &lt;strong&gt;I am only telling the highlights, both highs and lows, of my story&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the most part, the reason &lt;em&gt;why&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; I was lucky was simply because I forced myself to do several things and kept the ones that stuck. I have not written about, nor mentioned, many of those things. Trying a select few things and waiting for something to happen only works for a small group of fortunate people.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As I like to tell many of my friends&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-13&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-13&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;13&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;, &quot;Never compare your average life to other people&#x27;s highlights.&quot; You don&#x27;t know my average life, just my peaks and valleys.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chase your interests, not dollar signs. Had I stuck with my pursuit of computer science&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-14&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-14&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;14&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;, an interest formed purely on the basis of wanting a well-paying job, I would have been miserable. My pursuit of mathematics, something I truly enjoyed, took me even further.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some people don&#x27;t have this luxury. Sometimes, you&#x27;re forced to do something for money, or forced to chase after things you don&#x27;t enjoy.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That&#x27;s legitimate, but I must question: how is a young college student at this point in their life? It&#x27;s far too easy to look at other people&#x27;s successes or the state of the world and conclude it&#x27;s over for you, without actually assessing your available options, accomplishments, or time.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let this blog be a testament to the fact that I figured out my interests and made all my accomplishments in junior year, after two years of almost nothing, and went further than many people in my graduating class.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Besides, many vocational skills are extracurricular and achievable beyond the classroom. Studying something you enjoy will do volumes for your well-being and character development.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://dtnaylor.com/misc/tutorials/mathematics/real-analysis/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my guide on &lt;strong&gt;real analysis&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;! This is largely based on my notes from courses I took while an undergraduate math major. My goal is to offer an introduction into the subject that is accessible to non-math majors, while still maintaining mathematical rigor. My plan is to cover some (but not all) of the fundamentals, up until differentiation and integration theory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this blog is not meant to supplant a course in analysis. A proper introduction into real analysis will require a textbook. I personally recommend &lt;em&gt;Understanding Analysis&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; by Stephen Abbott, or &lt;em&gt;Principles of Mathematical Analysis&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; by Walter Rudin. The former is significantly more accessible, while the latter is a gold standard among undergraduate curriculums.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;prerequisites&quot;&gt;Prerequisites&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the nature of the subject, an above average mathematical maturity is necessary. Familiarity with proofs, set theory, and functions is assumed. Discrete mathematics is typically sufficient for this level of familiarity. These are not details that can be abstracted away, as doing so is antithetical to the goals of real analysis.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-real-analysis&quot;&gt;What is Real Analysis?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis is tricky for me to define. From Wikipedia:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real analysis studies the behavior of real numbers, sequences and series of real numbers, and real functions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is true, but not particularly illuminating. Another common definition of analysis is the rigorous undertones of calculus. Perhaps accurate, but still unsatisfying.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To me, real analysis is the study of approximation and limiting behavior.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; While this is the most simplistic definition, I find it the most intuitive. After all, real analysis is the foundation of much of applied mathematics, which itself is married to approximation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-learn-analysis&quot;&gt;Why learn analysis?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a question I commonly hear from non-math people, especially people going into statistics or data science programs that require analysis as a course.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truthfully, you don&#x27;t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; analysis for most applications. In fact, many people in industry probably know next-to-nothing about it. In terms of skills useful for a job, analysis is certainly nowhere near the top.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, broadly labeling analysis as &quot;useless math&quot; is, in my opinion, missing a huge chunk of the story. &lt;strong&gt;Analysis is largely what separates graduate-level (i.e. &quot;advanced&quot;) work in statistics &amp;amp; data science from undergraduate-level work.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; This is especially true for research in those fields, as well as research in any field adjacent to applied math (e.g. technology, engineering, etc.).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone at the graduate-level is certainly not using analysis in their day-to-day job, so it&#x27;s wrong to view analysis as something that offers many direct valuable skills. Rather, it offers a level of intuition and a mathematical foundation that enables understanding of much deeper topics. Many advanced topics become incredibly simple with a sufficient math background, and analysis is absolutely fundamental to those advanced topics.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why study analysis? &lt;strong&gt;Because it makes many things simpler to understand.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Especially if you plan on going into a research-oriented role, as the intuitions become necessary rather than a luxury.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-basics&quot;&gt;The Basics&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin covering real analysis by first discussing different types of numbers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Natural Numbers and Integers&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;natural numbers&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, denoted $\mathbb{N}$, are the set of whole numbers, starting from&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-1&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-1&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; 1. I.e.
$$
\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \dots \}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;integers&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, denoted&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-2&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-2&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; $\mathbb{Z}$, are the set of whole numbers, negative numbers, and 0. I.e.
$$
\mathbb{Z} = \{ \dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots \}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the natural numbers and integers form the most basic type of number system. In some sense, we can think of them as a starting point.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rational Numbers&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;rational numbers&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, denoted $\mathbb{Q}$, are the set of ratios of integers, i.e.
$$
\mathbb{Q} = \left\{ \frac{a}{b} : a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, b \neq 0 \right\}
$$
Generally, we assume that $a, b$ have no common factors (other than 1).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We call these &quot;rational&quot; numbers because they are a ratio of simpler building blocks, the integers. Indeed, the rational numbers encompass a vast majority of numbers we encounter in everyday life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the rationals have a nice property called &lt;strong&gt;density&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Between any two rational numbers, there exists another rational. Explicitly, if $r &amp;lt; s$ are both rational, then their average $\frac{r + s}{2}$ is also rational, and $r &amp;lt; \frac{r + s}{2} &amp;lt; s$. In some sense, this means the rationals are &quot;fine&quot;, unlike the integers, which are &quot;coarse&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite their ubiquity and density, the rationals do not encompass all numbers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof: Irrationality of $\sqrt{2}$&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than showing that the statement &quot;$\sqrt{2}$ is irrational&quot; is &lt;strong&gt;true&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, we show that its contrary, i.e. &quot;$\sqrt{2}$ is rational&quot;, must be &lt;strong&gt;false&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. In this way, we demonstrate that the statement must be true since it&#x27;s impossible for it to be false. While this logical approach seems rather roundabout, it&#x27;s a quite useful trick to make a problem more tractable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now assume the contrary, i.e. that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational. Then by definition of a rational number, we can find two integers $a, b$ such that
$$
\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b} \quad \textrm{for } a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, b \neq 0
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we noted earlier, we may assume that $a, b$ share no common factors other than 1. &lt;strong&gt;This step is crucial.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rearranging the equation above, we have that
$$
2b^2 = a^2
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, $a^2$ is a multiple of 2, so it is even. Since $a^2$ is even, we must have that $a$ is even. To see this, we note that if $a$ weren&#x27;t even, then it isn&#x27;t a multiple of 2, so $a^2$ could not possibly be a multiple of 2.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, since $a$ is even, we can write it as 2 times some integer. Formally, $a = 2k$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. As a result, we must have that
$$
2b^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 \implies b^2 = 2k^2
$$
So $b^2$ is even, therefore by the same logic as above, $b$ is also even. This means that $a, b$ share a common factor of 2. &lt;strong&gt;But we assumed earlier that $a, b$ do not share any factors, other than 1&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. This is a contradiction, so it&#x27;s impossible for $\sqrt{2}$ to be rational. Thus, $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &quot;incompleteness&quot; of $\mathbb{Q}$ motivates the definition of the real numbers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-1&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: This definition of $\mathbb{N}$ excludes 0, which is a major source of debate among mathematicians. However, this definition of $\mathbb{N}$ is the most common, and natural (ba-dum-tss), in analysis. If needed, we will use $\mathbb{N}_0$ to denote the natural numbers &lt;b&gt;including&lt;&#x2F;b&gt; 0.

    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Real Numbers&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;real numbers&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, denoted $\mathbb{R}$, is the set of all numbers that can be represented with an infinite decimal expansion. E.g. $\sqrt{2} = 1.41421\dots$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s easy to see that $\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}$. Moreover, just like the rationals, the reals have &lt;strong&gt;density&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. If $x &amp;lt; y$ are both real numbers, then their average $\frac{x + y}{2}$ is also real, and $x &amp;lt; \frac{x + y}{2} &amp;lt; y$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more importantly, there is a profound relationship between the rationals and the reals.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between any two real numbers, there exists a rational number.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explicitly, if $x &amp;lt; y$ are both real, then there exists $r \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $x &amp;lt; r &amp;lt; y$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we have to be a bit more clever than taking the average, since the average of two reals may not be rational.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof: Density of the Rationals in the Reals&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike before, we will prove this directly by explicitly constructing a rational number satisfying our statement. However, before we may proceed further, there are two crucial observations that we must make&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no such thing as a &quot;largest&quot; natural number. In other words, the natural numbers grow to infinity. Formally, $\mathbb{N}$ is unbounded&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-3&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-3&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; from above.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly, the integers run off to both positive infinity and negative infinity. Formally, $\mathbb{Z}$ is unbounded from below and from above.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to prove the theorem, let $x &amp;lt; y$ be any two real numbers. Our goal is to find a rational number between them. First, since the natural numbers are unbounded from above, we can find $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
$$
n &amp;gt; \frac{1}{y - x}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no trickery here, we simply take any natural number greater than $\frac{1}{y - x}$ (the reason for this will be clear shortly). Note that since $x &amp;lt; y$, $\frac{1}{y-x} &amp;gt; 0$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall from basic algebra that if $a &amp;gt; b &amp;gt; 0$, then $\frac{1}{a} &amp;lt; \frac{1}{b}$. Therefore,
$$
\frac{1}{n} &amp;lt; y - x
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives one half of the rational number we want.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To produce the second half, let $m \in \mathbb{Z}$ be the largest integer such that $m \leq nx$. Since $\mathbb{Z}$ is unbounded from below, such an $m$ exists. Then this tells us that
$$
m \leq nx &amp;lt; m + 1
$$
Why the second inequality? &lt;strong&gt;Because if it didn&#x27;t hold, then $m + 1 \leq nx$, meaning $m$ is not the &lt;u&gt;largest integer&lt;&#x2F;u&gt; such that $m \leq nx$.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (Recall that adding two integers together gives you another integer.) Therefore, we have
$$
\frac{m}{n} \leq x &amp;lt; \frac{m+1}{n}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting everything together, we have that
$$
\begin{aligned}
x &amp;amp;&amp;lt; \frac{m + 1}{n} \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{m}{n} + \frac{1}{n} &amp;amp;&amp;amp;\left( \textrm{Splitting the fracion} \right) \\
&amp;amp;\leq x + \frac{1}{n} &amp;amp;&amp;amp;\left( \frac{m}{n} \leq x \right) \\
&amp;amp;&amp;lt; x + (y - x) &amp;amp;&amp;amp;\left( \frac{1}{n} &amp;lt; y - x \right)\\
&amp;amp;= y
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which says precisely that $x &amp;lt; \frac{m + 1}{n} &amp;lt; y$. Thus, $r = \frac{m + 1}{n} \in \mathbb{Q}$ is the desired rational number.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An immediate consequence of this is that &lt;strong&gt;every real number can be approximated by a rational number&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to arbitrary precision. For example, $\sqrt{2}$ can be approximated by the rational number $1.41$ to two decimal places, $1.41421$ to five decimal places, and even $1.41421356237309504880$ to twenty decimal places. For any given error threshold and real number $x$, we can always find a rational number $r$ such that the distance between $x$ and $r$ is less than the error threshold.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we may begin to ask what the point of the reals are. After all, every real number can be approximated by a rational number. To further motivate this idea of &quot;completeness&quot;, we must segue into the concepts of bounds, infimums, and supremums.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upper and Lower Bounds&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let $M$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. We say that $a$ is an &lt;strong&gt;upper bound&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; of $M$ if
$$
\textrm{For every } x \in M, \quad x \leq a
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we say that $b$ is a &lt;strong&gt;lower bound&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; of $M$ if
$$
\textrm{For every } x \in M, \quad x \geq b
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, let $M = [0, 1)$. Then 2 is an upper bound of $M$, and -1 is a lower bound of $M$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;real-analysis&#x2F;upper_lower_bounds.webp&quot; alt=&quot;An illustration of the bounds of a set.&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Lower bound in blue, $M$ in green, and upper bound in red. Made with Desmos.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it&#x27;s not hard to see that we can do better. 1.5 and -0.5 are also upper and lower bounds, respectively. In fact, there are infinitely many upper and lower bounds for $M$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This motivates the definitions of the &lt;strong&gt;supremum&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;infimum&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, which are Latin for &quot;above&quot; and &quot;below&quot;, respectively.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supremum and Infimum&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let $M$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. The &lt;strong&gt;supremum&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; of $M$, denoted $\sup M$, is the least upper bound of $M$. More rigorously, $\sup M$ satisfies&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\begin{aligned}
&amp;amp;\textrm{(1) For every } x \in M, &amp;amp;&amp;amp;x \leq \sup M \\
&amp;amp;\textrm{(2) For every } \varepsilon &amp;gt; 0, &amp;amp;&amp;amp;\sup M - \varepsilon \textrm{ is not an upper bound of } M
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the &lt;strong&gt;infimum&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; of $M$, denoted $\inf M$, is the greatest lower bound of $M$. More rigorously, $\inf M$ satisfies&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\begin{aligned}
&amp;amp;\textrm{(I) For every } x \in M, &amp;amp;&amp;amp;x \geq \inf M \\
&amp;amp;\textrm{(II) For every } \varepsilon &amp;gt; 0, &amp;amp;&amp;amp;\inf M + \varepsilon \textrm{ is not a lower bound of } M
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While $\varepsilon$ (epsilon) may be any positive real number, we typically think of it as an astronomically tiny number.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property (1) ensures that the supremum is an upper bound, while property (2) ensures that it is the smallest such upper bound. Intuitively, property (2) says that if we nudge the supremum down by any amount, it will no longer be an upper bound. The same logic applies to the infimum.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;real-analysis&#x2F;illustration_of_supremum.webp&quot; alt=&quot;An illustration of the bounds of a set.&quot; style=&quot;height: 150px&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;If we nudge $\sup M$ to the left by any amount, we can find a blue point greater than it. Hence, it ceases to be an upper bound. Credit to Wikimedia Commons.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our previous example of $M = [0, 1)$, we have that $\sup M = 1$ and $\inf M = 0$, since for any $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$, we can always find numbers in $M$ that are greater than $1-\varepsilon$ and less than $0+\varepsilon$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we care about the supremum and infimum? Because this is precisely what separates the real numbers from the rational numbers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Completeness of the Reals&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If $M$ is a non-empty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above, then $\sup M$ exists and is a unique, real number. We call this the &lt;strong&gt;completeness property&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-4&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-4&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;4&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; of the real numbers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While completeness is stated only in terms of the supremum, it&#x27;s true for the infimum as well. We can simply consider the set $-M = \{ -x : x \in M \}$, and note that $\inf M = -\sup(-M)$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we&#x27;ve been alluding to, $\mathbb{Q}$ is not complete. For example, let
$$
A = \{ x \in \mathbb{Q} : x^2 &amp;lt; 2 \}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then $A$ is bounded above by 2, a rational number. In fact, there are infinitely many rational upper bounds. However, since $\sup A = \sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q}$, there is no &lt;strong&gt;smallest&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; rational upper bound of $A$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

In the same way that we built $\mathbb{Q}$ from $\mathbb{Z}$ with division, we can build $\mathbb{R}$ from $\mathbb{Q}$ with supremums (see Dedekind cuts). While you can prove this from first principles, it is incredibly difficult and tedious to do so.

And the last line is always true since $a \leq |a|$. So the triangle is equivalent to a statement that&#x27;s always true, therefore the triangle inequality is always true.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notation $\{a_n \}_{n=1}^{N}$ refers to the set $\{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N\}$. Similarly, $\{ a_n \}_{n=1}^{\infty} = \{a_1, a_2, \dots \}$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We say that a sequence $a_n$ &lt;strong&gt;converges&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to $a \in \mathbb{R}$ if, for every $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$, we can find $N = N(\varepsilon) \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
$$
n \geq N \implies |a_n - a| &amp;lt; \varepsilon
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To denote convergence to $a$, we may write $a_n \to a$ or $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} a_n = a$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a sequence doesn&#x27;t converge to any real number, we say it &lt;strong&gt;diverges&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notation $N(\varepsilon)$ simply means that $N$ may depend on $\varepsilon$. For example, define the sequence $a_n = \frac{1}{n}$. For any $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$, choose $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $N &amp;gt; \frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ (possible because $\mathbb{N}$ is unbounded from above). Then we have that
$$
n \geq N \implies \left| a_n - 0 \right| = \frac{1}{n} \leq \frac{1}{N} &amp;lt; \varepsilon
$$
Which says precisely that $a_n \to 0$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;real-analysis&#x2F;convergence.webp&quot; alt=&quot;An illustration of convergence.&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;As long as $n$ is sufficiently large, we can guarantee that the distance between $a_n$ and $a$ is less than $\varepsilon$. Made with Desmos.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give an example of divergence, consider the sequence $b_n = (-1)^{n}$. Then we can enumerate $b_n$ as $\{-1, 1, -1, 1, \dots\} = \{ -1, 1 \}$. Thus, if $b_n \to b$, then either $b = -1$ or $b = 1$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first show that $b = 1$ is impossible. By definition of $b_n$,
$$
|b_n - 1| = \begin{cases}
2 &amp;amp;\textrm{if $n$ is odd} \\
0 &amp;amp;\textrm{if $n$ is even}
\end{cases}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if we take $\varepsilon = 0.01$, then we cannot guarantee that $|b_n - 1| &amp;lt; \varepsilon$ &lt;strong&gt;for every $n$ sufficiently large.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; No matter how large we make $N$, we can always find some $n \geq N$ such that $|b_n - 1| \geq \varepsilon$. This says precisely that $b_n$ does not converge to $1$, i.e. $b_n \not\to 1$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case for $b = -1$ is identical to above. Therefore, $b_n$ diverges.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If $a_n \to a$, then $a$ is unique. More formally, if $a_n \to a$ and $a_n \to b$, then $a = b$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This essentially means that our notion of convergence is well-defined, and that sequences may only converge to one number (hence, why the $b_n$ example above failed).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof: Uniqueness of Limits&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assume $a_n \to a$ and $a_n \to b$. To prove the statement, we simply need to show that $a = b$. That is, $a_n$ always converges to the same number.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appeal to the definition of convergence. Pick any $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$. Since $a_n \to a$, we can find $N_a \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
$$
n \geq N_a \implies |a_n - a| &amp;lt; \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that $\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ is simply just another number. Similarly, since $a_n \to b$, we can find $N_b \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
$$
n \geq N_b \implies |a_n - b| &amp;lt; \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&#x27;t know whether $N_a$ and $N_b$ are the same, since $a_n \to a$ and $a_n \to b$ are separate statements. However, since convergence only relies on $n$ being &lt;strong&gt;greater&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; than them, it really doesn&#x27;t matter. Both statements are true as long as $n$ is greater than $N_a$ &lt;em&gt;and&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; $N_b$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when $n \geq \max\{ N_a, N_b \}$, we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
|a - b| &amp;amp;= |(a_n - b) - (a_n - a)|  &amp;amp;&amp;amp;\left( \textrm{Adding and subtracting $a_n$} \right) \\
&amp;amp;\leq |a_n - a| + |a_n - b| &amp;amp;&amp;amp;\left( \textrm{Triangle Inequality} \right) \\
&amp;amp;&amp;lt; \frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{2} &amp;amp;&amp;amp;\left( \textrm{Both terms less than } \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \right) \\
&amp;amp;= \varepsilon
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that $|a - b|$ is independent of $n$. Therefore, $|a - b| &amp;lt; \varepsilon$ for &lt;b&gt;any&lt;&#x2F;b&gt; $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since $|a - b|$ is independent of $\varepsilon$, it can be made arbitrarily small while also remaining constant. This is only possible when $|a - b| = 0$. In other words, $a - b = 0 \iff a = b$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let $a_n$ be a sequence. We say that $a_n$ is a &lt;strong&gt;Cauchy sequence&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; if, for every $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$, there exists $N = N(\varepsilon) \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
$$
n, m \geq N \implies |a_n - a_m| &amp;lt; \varepsilon
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, a sequence is Cauchy if the terms get arbitrarily close to each other. Convergent sequences have this property.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof: Convergent Sequences are Cauchy&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pick any $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$. Since $a_n \to a$, we can find $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
$$
n \geq N \implies |a_n - a| &amp;lt; \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then for any $m, n \geq N$, we have that
$$
\begin{aligned}
|a_n - a_m| &amp;amp;= |(a_n - a) - (a_m - a)| &amp;amp;&amp;amp;\left( \textrm{Adding and subtracting } a \right) \\
&amp;amp;\leq |a_n - a| + |a_m - a|  &amp;amp;&amp;amp;\left( \textrm{Triangle Inequality} \right) \\
&amp;amp;&amp;lt; \frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{2} &amp;amp;&amp;amp;\left( \textrm{Both terms less than } \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \right) \\
&amp;amp;= \varepsilon
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, $m, n \geq N \implies |a_m - a_n| &amp;lt; \varepsilon$, which says precisely that $a_n$ is Cauchy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marvelously, Cauchy sequences capture the idea of convergence without invoking convergence. Instead, it relies on the idea of &quot;closeness&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One may ask whether there exists non-convergent Cauchy sequences. The answer is it depends. The answer is also precisely what separates $\mathbb{R}$ from $\mathbb{Q}$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let $E$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. We say $E$ is &lt;strong&gt;complete&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-5&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-5&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;5&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; if every Cauchy sequence in $E$ converges to a point in $E$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, a space is complete if there aren&#x27;t any &quot;gaps&quot;. To be incomplete means that a sequence may approach a hole with nothing in it. As such, $\mathbb{R}$ is complete, while $\mathbb{Q}$ isn&#x27;t. This is to say that &lt;strong&gt;every Cauchy sequence converges in $\mathbb{R}$, but may not converge in $\mathbb{Q}$.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Indeed, &quot;supremum completeness&quot; and &quot;Cauchy completeness&quot; are saying the same thing, though it&#x27;s not obvious why.

&lt;p&gt;While this section is a bit of a diversion from the prior, point-set topology is fundamental to real analysis. Viewing things under a topological lens often greatly simplifies problems. Moreover, it builds good intuition.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topology feels rather abstract. However, it is essentially &quot;geometry without distance&quot;. Rather than quantifying &quot;closeness&quot; with distance, we quantify &quot;closeness&quot; with open sets.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;open-sets&quot;&gt;Open Sets&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we can define an open set, we must first define a neighborhood.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, a set is open if every point has &quot;breathing room&quot; in every direction. Points on the boundary do not have this &quot;breathing room&quot;, since any neighborhood around them must include points outside the set.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let $M$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. A point $x \in \mathbb{R}$ is a &lt;strong&gt;limit point&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; of $M$ if for every $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$, the neighborhood $N_\varepsilon (x)$ contains at least one point of $M$, excluding $x$ itself. More formally,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\textrm{For every } \varepsilon &amp;gt; 0, \quad (N_\varepsilon (x) \setminus \{ x \} ) \cap M \neq \varnothing
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This definition may seem tricky, but the idea is rather simple. Consider the set
$$
A = \left\{ \frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{N} \right\}
$$
Then 0 is a limit point of $A$, since for any $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$, we can find $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{k} &amp;lt; \varepsilon$. Thus, $\frac{1}{k} \in N_\varepsilon (0)$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closed Sets&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let $C$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. We say that $C$ is &lt;strong&gt;closed&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; if it contains all of its limit points. More formally, if $x$ is a limit point of $C$, then $x \in C$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closed sets are commonly thought of as sets that contain their boundaries. While not fully accurate, it&#x27;s helpful intuition, since boundary points are precisely the limit points that are not within the &quot;interior&quot; of the set.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the previous example, the set&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\left\{ \frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{N} \right\} \cup \{ 0 \}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is closed, since it contains its only limit point, 0. Moreover, the interval $[0, 1]$ is closed, since it contains all its limits points (which, coincidentally, is the entire set).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;open-and-closed-sets&quot;&gt;Open and Closed Sets&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important relationship between open and closed sets is that they are complements of each other.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof: Complementarity of Open and Closed Sets&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We really have two statements to prove. Namely, that $U \textrm{ open} \implies U^c \textrm{ closed}$ and $U \textrm{ open} \impliedby U^c \textrm{ closed}$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;($\implies$): Assume $U$ is open. We have to show that $U^c$ contains all its limit points, so let $x$ be any limit point of $U^c$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By definition of a limit point, for every $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$, the neighborhood $N_\varepsilon (x)$ contains at least one point of $U^c$, excluding $x$ itself. This means that $N_\varepsilon (x) \nsubseteq U$ for every $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$. Since $U$ is open, $x \notin U$. Therefore, $x \in U^c$, so $U^c$ contains all its limit points.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If the explanation for $x \notin U$ didn&#x27;t make sense, here&#x27;s an intuitive explanation. Since $U$ is open, every point in $U$ must have &quot;breathing room&quot;. We showed that $x$ lacks this &quot;breathing room&quot;, so $x$ cannot be in $U$.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;($\impliedby$): Now assume $U^c$ is closed. We have to show that every point in $U$ has &quot;breathing room&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let $x \in U$. Since $U^c$ is closed, it contains all its limit points, so $x$ is &lt;strong&gt;not a limit point&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; of $U^c$. This must mean that we can find some $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$ such that $N_\varepsilon (x)$ contains no points of $U^c$. Thus, $N_\varepsilon (x) \subseteq U$. This says precisely that $U$ is open.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sequences-and-topology&quot;&gt;Sequences and Topology&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you may be inclined to ask why the topology diversion. After all, there&#x27;s no obvious connection between the prior discussion and topology.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m here to say that they&#x27;re really the same thing, just viewed under different lenses. Let&#x27;s revisit the example
$$
A = \left\{ \frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{N} \right\}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now define $a_n = \frac{1}{n}$. Then $ \{ a_n \}_{n=1}^{\infty} = A$. We showed that $a_n \to 0$, and that $0$ is the only limit point of $A$. Indeed, these are both saying the same thing. To say $a_n \to 0$ means that $n \geq N \implies |a_n - 0| &amp;lt; \varepsilon$. In other words, if $n \geq N$, the neighborhood $N_\varepsilon (0)$ contains $a_n$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This observation is formalized with the following theorem&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As before, we really have two statements to prove.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;($\implies$): Assume $a_n \to a$, and let $U$ be an open set containing $a$. We must show that $U$ contains all, but finitely many, elements of $a_n$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since $U$ is open, we may find some $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$ such that $N_\varepsilon (a) \subseteq U$. Moreover, since $a_n \to a$, we can find $N$ such that $n \geq N \implies |a_n - a| &amp;lt; \varepsilon$. Then $n \geq N \implies a_n \in N_\varepsilon (a) \subseteq U$, so $U$ contains all, but finitely many, $a_n$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;($\impliedby$): Assume every open set containing $a$ also contains all, but finitely many, elements of $a_n$. We will proceed by contradiction and show that the contrary is impossible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So assume $a_n \not\to a$. Then we can find $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$ such that $|a_n - a| \geq \varepsilon$ for infinitely many $n$. In other words, the open set $N_\varepsilon (a)$ is missing infinitely many $a_n$. Thus, we found an open set containing $a$, yet fails to contain &lt;b&gt;all, but finitely many&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;, $a_n$. This is a contradiction, and hence we must have that $a_n \to a$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This formalizes topology as &quot;geometry without distance&quot;, since convergence is characterized entirely by open sets. In other words, we characterize convergence not by distance, but by membership in certain sets.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extending all our discussion to functions, and thus making analysis much more applicable beyond sequences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;usual-notions-of-continuity&quot;&gt;Usual Notions of Continuity&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many definitions of continuity, with some being more useful than others. We focus on 3 of them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ where $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. We say $f$ is &lt;strong&gt;continuous&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; at $x_0$ if, for every $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$, we can find some $\delta = \delta(x_0, \varepsilon) &amp;gt; 0$ such that&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
y \in X \textrm{ and } |x_0 - y| &amp;lt; \delta \implies |f(x_0) - f(y)| &amp;lt; \varepsilon
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that $\delta = \delta(x_0, \varepsilon)$ means that $\delta$ may depend on both $x_0$ and $\varepsilon$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuively, this definition says the following. For every error-bound $\varepsilon$ of the outputs we impose in the codomain, we can find a corresponding error-bound $\delta$ of the inputs in the domain. In other words, saying that $f$ is continuous at $x_0$ is saying that $f$ &lt;strong&gt;preserves &quot;closeness&quot; at $f(x_0)$&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Having a tiny bit of error in $x_0$ implies a tiny bit of error in $f(x_0)$ (i.e. no sudden &quot;jumps&quot;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this definition is good, there is another, and more natural in my opinion, way to think of continuity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ where $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. We say $f$ is &lt;strong&gt;continuous&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; at $x_0$ if, for every sequence $x_n$ such that $x_n \to x_0$, we have that $f(x_n) \to f(x_0)$. Writing this formally,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
x_n \to x_0 \implies f(x_n) \to f(x_0)
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This definition has an immediate interpretation. &lt;strong&gt;If a function is continuous at $x_0$, then it preserves sequences that converge to $x_0$&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. In other words, a function is continuous if and only if it preserves convergence of sequences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I would not introduce two separate definitions if they weren&#x27;t saying the same thing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;($\implies$): Assume $f$ is $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-continuous, and let $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$. Take any sequence $x_n$ such that $x_n \to x_0$. We must show that $f(x_n) \to f(x_0)$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since $f$ is $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-continuous, we may find a $\delta$ such that
$$
|x_0 - y| &amp;lt; \delta \implies |f(x_0) - f(y)| &amp;lt; \varepsilon
$$
Since $x_n \to x_0$, we can find $N$ such that $n \geq N \implies |x_n - x_0| &amp;lt; \delta$. Then we have that $n \geq N \implies |f(x_0) - f(x_n)| &amp;lt; \varepsilon$. Hence, $f(x_n) \to f(x_0)$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;($\impliedby$): Assume $f$ is sequentially continuous at $x_0$. Similar to the topological convergence proof above, we will proceed by contradiction and show that we can violate the requirement $x_n \to x_0 \implies f(x_n) \to x_0$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So assume $f$ is not $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-continuous at $x_0$. Then there exists some $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$ such that, for every $\delta &amp;gt; 0$ and some $y = y(\delta) \in X$, we have
$$
|x_0 - y| &amp;lt; \delta, \textrm{ yet } |f(x_0) - f(y)| \geq \varepsilon
$$
Using this fact, we may construct a sequence $x_n$ such that
$$
|x_0 - x_n| &amp;lt; \frac{1}{n}, \textrm{ yet } |f(x_0) - f(x_n)| \geq \varepsilon
$$
That is, we specify $\delta = \frac{1}{n}$, and set $x_n$ to be some $y$ that satisfies this condition. By construction, we have that $x_n \to x_0$. Yet since $|f(x_0) - f(x_n)| \geq \varepsilon$ for every $n$, we have that $f(x_n) \not\to f(x_0)$. Then $f$ can&#x27;t be sequentially continuous, which is a contradiction.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;topological-continuity&quot;&gt;Topological Continuity&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more general, and mathematically useful in my opinion, definition of continuity is the topological definition of continuity. This definition motivates many nice generalizations, such as measurable functions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ where $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. We say $f$ is &lt;strong&gt;continuous&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; if, for every open set $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, the pre-image $f^{-1} (U) \subseteq X$ is also open.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two important things to note here&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a &lt;strong&gt;global&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; definition of continuity, whereas the prior two definitions were &lt;strong&gt;local&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; definitions (i.e. true at a single point).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the domain $X \neq \mathbb{R}$, the definition of &quot;open&quot; changes slightly, though not significantly. &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;math.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;210815&#x2F;could-someone-explain-the-concept-of-a-set-being-open-relative-to-another-set&quot;&gt;Those interested should read this stack exchange.&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it&#x27;s not obvious why topological continuity is at all related to previous notions of continuity, especially &quot;closeness&quot;. The intuition here is the following.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding topology as &quot;geometry without distance&quot;, we interpret open sets as one way to quantify &quot;closeness&quot;. When we say that $U \textrm{ open} \implies f^{-1} (U) \textrm{ open}$, we are requiring that any way we decide to quantify closeness in the codomain (namely, through $U$) should correspond to some quantification of closeness in the domain (namely, through $f^{-1} (U)$). In other words, we require that $f$ respects the &quot;closeness&quot; structure of both the domain and codomain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to see how topological continuity is related is to simply prove that it is equivalent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof: Continuity and Topological Continuity&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;($\implies$): Assume $f$ is topologically continuous. Pick any $x_0 \in X$. We must show that $f$ is $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-continuous at $x_0$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$. Consider the open set $N_\varepsilon (f(x_0))$. By assumption, we have that
$$
f^{-1} \left( N_\varepsilon (f(x_0)) \right) \textrm{ is open}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since $x_0 \in f^{-1} \left( N_\varepsilon (f(x_0)) \right)$, we can find some $\delta &amp;gt; 0$ such that $N_\delta (x_0) \subseteq f^{-1} \left( N_\varepsilon (f(x_0)) \right)$. This says precisely that, if $y \in N_\delta (x_0)$, then we have
$$
|x_0 - y| &amp;lt; \delta \implies |f(x_0) - f(y)| &amp;lt; \varepsilon
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning $f$ is $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-continuous at $x_0$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;($\impliedby$): Assume $f$ is $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-continuous at every $x_0 \in X$. For ease, we may rewrite the definition of $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-continuous as follows
$$
\begin{aligned}
&amp;amp;|x_0 - y| &amp;lt; \delta \implies |f(x_0) - f(y)| &amp;lt; \varepsilon \\
\iff &amp;amp;y \in N_{\delta} (x_0) \implies f(y) \in N_\varepsilon (f(x_0)) \\
\iff &amp;amp;f(N_{\delta} (x_0)) \subseteq N_\varepsilon (f(x_0))
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, being $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-continuous is the same as saying that the image of an open ball is contained in another open ball.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let $U$ be open, and take any $x_0 \in f^{-1} (U)$. Then $f(x_0) \in U$. Since $U$ is open, we can find $\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0$ such that $N_\varepsilon (f(x_0)) \subseteq U$. Moreover, because $f$ is $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-continuous at $x_0$, we can find some $\delta &amp;gt; 0$ such that $f(N_{\delta} (x_0)) \subseteq N_\varepsilon (f(x_0))$ by the above statements. Thus
$$
\begin{aligned}
&amp;amp;f(N_{\delta} (x_0)) \subseteq N_\varepsilon (f(x_0)) \\
\iff &amp;amp;f^{-1} \left[ f(N_{\delta} (x_0)) \right] \subseteq f^{-1} \left[ N_\varepsilon (f(x_0)) \right] \\
\implies &amp;amp;N_{\delta} (x_0) \subseteq f^{-1} \left[ N_\varepsilon (f(x_0)) \right] \subseteq f^{-1} (U) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \left[ \textrm{For any set $A$, }A \subseteq f^{-1} (f(A)) \right]
\end{aligned}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which says precisely that for every $x_0$, we can find a neighborhood around $x_0$ such that $N_{\delta} (x_0) \subseteq f^{-1} (U)$. Therefore, $f^{-1} (U)$ is open.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this tutorial serves as an introduction, and misses on a few important topics. In particular, this guide lacks discussion on compact sets, subsequences, and series, all of which are also important to analysis. Notwithstanding, I did not want this guide to run on for too long, so I omitted their discussion.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to reach out to me if anything is confusing or poorly explained. I appreciate any and all feedback :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to an &lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Linear Regression&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;! This tutorial is largely adapted from a &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;colab.research.google.com&#x2F;drive&#x2F;1FWJCDERu4hlZi4dTsuf2PVleSv9nwdyR?authuser=1&quot;&gt;similar workshop&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; I hosted while I was an officer at &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datascienceucsb.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Data Science UCSB&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. However, in the interest of simplicity, I trimmed much of the material and modified many explanations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide is intended to introduce the principles behind regression, and present linear regression from a data science angle. I intend this largely for beginners who are new to the field, but have some exposure with freshman-level math (e.g. linear algebra).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;prerequisites&quot;&gt;Prerequisites&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume that you are comfortable with the following&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technology
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NumPy, Pandas&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mathematics
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linear Algebra
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vectors, matrices, linear systems, norms (length&#x2F;magnitude)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, I abstracted away the statistical theory and inference behind linear regression. However, I recognize that doing so misses a large part of the story, especially when it comes to interpretability. I intend to write a follow-up guide with these details included.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;data&quot;&gt;Data&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One may object that using simulated data not only begs the question, but also fails to demonstrate applicability. While I agree, finding data compatible with linear regression is incredibly easy. Furthermore, linear regression is so incredibly fundamental that its applicability is not something that needs to be demonstrated.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-regression&quot;&gt;What is Regression?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say we&#x27;re interested in modeling a relationship between a &lt;strong&gt;reponse&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; $Y$, and a bunch of &lt;strong&gt;explanatory&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; variables $X_1, \dots, X_p$. For example, we may be interested in finding a relationship between&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$Y = $ Average traffic accidents in a day&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$X_1 = $ Average temperature, $X_2 = $ Day of week, $X_3 = $ Month of year&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To write this down mathematically, we are trying to find a function $f$ such that&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
Y = f(X_1, \dots, X_p) + \epsilon
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where $\epsilon$ represents an error term. The process of finding such a $f$ that minimizes the error is called&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-1&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-1&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;regression&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-1&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: This isn&#x27;t always true. Regression is really about finding the &quot;best possible&quot; function, where &quot;best possible&quot; is defined in a clear and tractable way. For our purposes though, let&#x27;s stick with this framework of minimizing error.
    &lt;&#x2F;small&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-problem-with-regression&quot;&gt;A Problem with Regression&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the problem I outlined above may seem straightforward to solve, it&#x27;s really vague and broad. For instance, consider the following function
$$
f(X_1, \dots, X_p) = \begin{cases}
0 &amp;amp;\text{if we have never seen } X_1, \dots, X_p \\
Y &amp;amp;\text{if we have seen } X_1, \dots, X_p
\end{cases}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In plain English&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Output the answer if we know it. Otherwise, output 0.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shouldn&#x27;t be hard to see why this function is a terrible idea. However, as far as the math is concerned, this is the best possible fit for our data. After all, there&#x27;s no way to know how wrong we are on stuff we&#x27;ve never seen before.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent ridiculous solutions like this, we limit ourselves to a certain &lt;strong&gt;class of functions&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. For example, we might say that&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are only allowed to consider functions of the form $f(x) = \alpha \sin(x)$ for some constant $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are only allowed to consider functions that satisfy the differential equation $f&#x27;(x) = x f(x)$.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are only allowed to consider the following list
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$x^2 &#x2F; y$&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\log(x) + y$&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$y^x$&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can define our class of functions however we want. Above, we explicitly write down the functional form as in (1), write down a condition as in (2), or specify a list as in (3). The class of functions we consider depends heavily on the problem at hand, such as how many inputs there are, and other domain-specific constraints.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we do this? &lt;strong&gt;Aside from filtering out dumb solutions, the problem becomes much more tractable.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;linear-regression&quot;&gt;Linear Regression&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we say &lt;strong&gt;linear&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; regression, we are restricting ourselves to the class of &lt;strong&gt;linear&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; functions&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-2&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-2&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;. That is, we say that
$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \dots + \beta_p X_p + \epsilon
$$
And the problem now amounts to finding the coefficients $\vec{\beta} = \left( \beta_0, \dots, \beta_p \right)$ such that $\epsilon$ is as small as possible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote-2&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: none&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: Actually, linear regression just means we have a linear function in terms of our coefficients. That is, $Y$ is a linear combination of $\beta_0, \dots, \beta_p$.
    &lt;&#x2F;small&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-setup&quot;&gt;The Setup&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until here, I&#x27;ve been writing everything as a simple equation, but in truth we really have a system of equations. We have a list of response data $(y_1, \dots, y_n)$. For each response $y_i$, we have some corresponding explanatory data $(x_{i1}, \dots, x_{ip})$. This leads us to the system of equations&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\begin{align*}
y_1 &amp;amp;= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{11} + \beta_2 x_{12} + \dots + \beta_p x_{1p} + ϵ_1 \\
y_2 &amp;amp;= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{21} + \beta_2 x_{22} + \dots + \beta_p x_{2p} + ϵ_2 \\
&amp;amp;\vdots \\
y_n &amp;amp;= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{n1} + \beta_2 x_{n2} + \dots + \beta_p x_{np} + ϵ_n \\
\end{align*}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rewriting this in terms of matrices&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\begin{align*}
\begin{bmatrix}
y_1 \\
y_2 \\
\vdots \\
y_n
\end{bmatrix}
&amp;amp;=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp;amp; x_{11} &amp;amp; x_{12} &amp;amp; \dots &amp;amp; x_{1p} \\
1 &amp;amp; x_{21} &amp;amp; x_{22} &amp;amp; \dots &amp;amp; x_{2p} \\
\vdots &amp;amp; \vdots &amp;amp; \vdots &amp;amp; \ddots &amp;amp; \vdots \\
1 &amp;amp; x_{n1} &amp;amp; x_{n2} &amp;amp; \dots &amp;amp; x_{np} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\beta_0 \\
\beta_1 \\
\beta_2 \\
\vdots \\
\beta_p
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
\epsilon_1 \\
\epsilon_2 \\
\vdots \\
\epsilon_n
\end{bmatrix} \\
&amp;amp;\\
\iff \mathbf{Y} &amp;amp;= \mathbf{X}\vec{\beta} + E \\
\iff \mathbf{Y} &amp;amp;= \hat{\mathbf{Y}} + E
\end{align*}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\mathbf{Y} = (y_1, \dots, y_n)$ is the vector of &lt;strong&gt;true&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; values, $\hat{\mathbf{Y}} = (\hat{y}_1, \dots, \hat{y}_n)$ is the vector of &lt;strong&gt;predicted&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; values, and $E = ( \epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_n )$ is the &lt;strong&gt;error&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; vector.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our predictions depend entirely on our coefficients $\vec{\beta}$, i.e. $\hat{\mathbf{Y}} = \mathbf{X}\vec{\beta}$.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;finding-our-coefficients&quot;&gt;Finding our Coefficients&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, our goal is to make our predictions $\hat{\mathbf{Y}}$ as close to the truth $\mathbf{Y}$ as possible. In other words, we want to choose our coefficients $\vec{\beta}$ such that we minimize the error vector $E = \mathbf{Y} - \hat{\mathbf{Y}}$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there&#x27;s some nuance here. &lt;strong&gt;What does it mean to &quot;minimize the error vector&quot;?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Another way to pose this issue is&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we measure a vector?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-least-squares-approach&quot;&gt;The Least Squares Approach&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The least squares approach tells us that &lt;strong&gt;we should measure the error vector using its magnitude&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. That is, we &quot;minimize the error vector&quot; by making $||E||$ as small as possible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? &lt;strong&gt;Because doing so minimizes the distance between $\mathbf{Y}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{Y}}$.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#x27;&#x2F;images&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;linear-regression&#x2F;ols_visualization.webp&#x27;&#x2F;&gt;
    &lt;caption&gt;&lt;small&gt;Note that this is a visual aid. In practice, these vectors have hundreds of dimensions, so &quot;distance&quot; has no physical meaning.&lt;&#x2F;small&gt;&lt;&#x2F;caption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We call this the least squares approach because minimizing $||E||$ is the same as minimizing its square, $||E||^{2}$, and
$$
||E||^{2} = (\epsilon_1)^2 + \dots + (\epsilon_n)^2
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#x27;re really minimizing the sum of squared errors. Using a bit of calculus, &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stats.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;138342&quot;&gt;it&#x27;s rather easy to figure out what this optimal $\vec{\beta}$ is&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. I leave this detail aside since knowing the exact formula is unimportant for understanding.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;examples&quot;&gt;Examples&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The math here has been rather dense, so let&#x27;s bring ourselves back into the real-world and construct some models. All the models that follow are based on the data presented at the start of this guide.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;line-of-best-fit&quot;&gt;Line of Best Fit&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use the model&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\begin{align*}
&amp;amp;Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon \\
\iff &amp;amp;\hat{Y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X
\end{align*}

&lt;p&gt;Rather than finding a line of best fit, say we instead want to use
$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \dots + \beta_k X^k + \epsilon
$$
That is, fit a $k$-degree polynomial instead of a line. After all, we know $X$, so finding powers of $X$ is an easy task. This may not seem linear, but it is. &lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-b&#x27;&gt;See footnote b for a brief comment why&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our example, we will use $k=25$. That is, fit a 25 degree polynomial.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s fairly clear that the polynomial models does a rather poor job at predicting the new data, especially on the tails. (It&#x27;s not obvious in the picture, but the right-most point has a prediction in the billions.) While it felt like the polynomial model did a good job with the original data, it does a poor job with everything else.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon is called &lt;strong&gt;overfitting&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Overfitting means that the model fits its &lt;strong&gt;training data&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; too well, to the point that it&#x27;s all but useless for outside data. In other words, we dug ourselves into a situation where the model is only telling us what we already know, and nothing more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we may know how to train models, we need some criteria by which to evaluate them. After all, how do we know if our model is good? This is especially important in order to identify overfitting. Fortunately, there are many tools available to us at our disposal.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;train-test-split&quot;&gt;Train-Test Split&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general rule of thumb, you should always partition your data into two categories: &lt;strong&gt;training&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; data and &lt;strong&gt;testing&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; data. As the names suggest, the training data is used to find coefficients, while the testing data is used to evaluate generalizability. A common ratio is 75% train and 25% test, though this is completely arbitrary (in this article, we used a 50&#x2F;50 ratio).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we do this? To test two things&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To check if our model is &lt;strong&gt;overfitting&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; the data.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To see how well our model &lt;strong&gt;generalizes&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to unseen data.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good model should not only have satisfactory evaluations across both datasets, it should also have very similar evaluations. Otherwise, there&#x27;s a clear sign that some form of overfitting is taking place.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many packages that will do this partitioning for you. &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scikit-learn.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;modules&#x2F;generated&#x2F;sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html&quot;&gt;Scikit-learn has one that works very well.&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;r-2-score&quot;&gt;$R^2$ Score&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $R^2$ score is a measurement of how well explanatory variance predicts the response variance. Setting $\bar{y}$ as the average of the responses, $R^2$ is defined as
$$
\begin{align}
R^2 &amp;amp;= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{y}_i - \bar{y})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2} \\
\nonumber \\
&amp;amp;\overset{(!)}{=} 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}
\end{align}
$$
(1) gives us a clear interpretation of $R^2$ as a ratio of variances. More specifically, the numerator is proportional to the variance of the predictions, while the denominator is proportional to the variance of the response variables. In essence, $R^2$ tells us the amount of response variance explained by the predictions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) is how $R^2$ is computed in many packages, including scikit-learn. However, note that the equality between (1) and (2) is only true over the training data. It is not true in general. (2) is preferred because it&#x27;s more intuitive to write a metric in terms of error&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-3&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-3&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, the polynomial model is performing terribly, achieving a score well-below 0. Since $R^2$ represents a ratio, anything below 0 indicates a serious misfit&lt;sup class=&#x27;opacity-60 footnote&#x27; id=&#x27;footnote-4&#x27;&gt;&lt;a href=&#x27;#footnote-body-4&#x27; style=&#x27;text-decoration: none&#x27;&gt;4&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is much more about $R^2$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#x27;s mainly useful for evaluating performance on your training data, as interpreting it as a ratio between variances relies on this fact. Evaluating it on outside data loses this interpretation, and thus much its value.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The attentive reader will note that we did precisely this in the above example.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has very questionable efficacy, as &quot;explained variance&quot; is not always a desirable outcome. Good models can have low $R^2$, and terrible models can have high $R^2$.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact, high $R^2$ ($&amp;gt;0.95$) is a good sign of overfitting.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$R^2$ says nothing more beyond what&#x27;s outlined above. It depends on many different things, and using it for model selection is very dubious.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;

However, there is a reason why $R^2$ still remains a very popular metric. As with many statistics, it&#x27;s useful but dangerous.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One big pitfall of mean squared error is its sensitivity to outliers. This comes from the fact that $\mathrm{big}^2 = \mathrm{bigger}$. In fact, we see this behavior above, since one single datapoint is drastically inflating the MSE for the polynomial model.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s also important to note the units of MSE, as it&#x27;s given in units of $Y^2$ rather than $Y$. As a result, interpreting this as a quantity can be rather difficult.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in spite of its pitfalls, note that everything in this blog revolves around MSE. After all, when we use least squares, we are defining &quot;best coefficients&quot; in terms of squared error. As before, a useful but dangerous statistic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going over every evaluation metric available is simply not a good use of our time. However, know that there are many different metrics, each with their own purpose. Which one you use depends entirely on your application.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this just about summarizes an overview into linear regression. Yet, there&#x27;s a much bigger world I have not mentioned whatsoever. Namely, alternatives to least squares, as well as the statistical inference and interpretability behind linear regression. I intend to write future tutorials covering these topics, particularly regularization and a statistical-based overview.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://dtnaylor.com/writing/certain-level/">&lt;p&gt;During my two years as an officer of &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datascienceucsb.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Data Science UCSB&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, I frequently interacted with hundreds of club members, predominantly &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;catalog.ucsb.edu&#x2F;programs&#x2F;BSSTSDS&quot;&gt;Statistics &amp;amp; Data Science&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(SDS)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.ucsb.edu&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Computer Science&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(CS)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; majors. Most of them were awesome, either ambitious beginners wanting to learn more, or seasoned veterans tackling interesting projects.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in a few rare occasions, I encountered people who possessed a certain level of arrogance. Every major has their fair share of unpleasant people, but CS and SDS especially had an over-representation of them. While a vocal minority, I have experienced this trait disproportionately first-hand. After having talked about it with so many people around me, I can&#x27;t help but feel that there&#x27;s an underlying reason behind it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take What I Say Lightly&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not writing this blog with the intention of insulting anyone. Rather, I write this to illustrate an unproductive and downright unpleasant mindset I encountered more often than I can tolerate. My hope is to both bring this topic to light, and to steer people away from it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I may seem to speak in absolutes, this is definitely not the case. It is not my intention to slander anyone, nor to suggest that they are inferior. Many of my greatest friends come from CS and SDS backgrounds. What I am focusing on, however, is a very vocal &lt;strong&gt;minority&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; that unfortunately is over-represented in these fields.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-this-certain-level-of-arrogance&quot;&gt;What is this &quot;certain level of arrogance&quot;?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To introduce what I mean, allow me to explain by way of example. But rather than focusing on a negative example illustrating arrogance, I&#x27;ll focus on a positive example illustrating the exact opposite. In this way, I can hone in on elements neglected by this arrogance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I obtained permission from the project members to write about their project. However, in the interest of privacy, I will not disclose anything more than the project itself.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;datadrip&quot;&gt;DataDrip&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DataDrip was a project in Data Science UCSB. It was one of the finalists for Project Showcase 2025, ultimately winning a cash prize. The premise of this project is that you submit a picture of your face, and it returns a wardrobe of fashion items. In essence, the project is finding &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kontentino.com&#x2F;social-media-urban-dictionary&#x2F;drip&#x2F;&quot;&gt;&quot;drip&quot;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that will complement you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at first glance this may seem questionable, the project was very well-thought-out. Color analysis motivates the entire approach, namely the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;lifestyle&#x2F;style&#x2F;color-analysis-what-looks-best-on-you&#x2F;2021&#x2F;08&#x2F;16&#x2F;16174e96-f92a-11eb-9c0e-97e29906a970_story.html&quot;&gt;four seasons categorization&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The idea here is that skin tone determines what &quot;season&quot; you are, which narrows down a list of suitable clothing items. My understanding of the project is it extracts facial features into embeddings via a pre-trained model, and from there uses heuristics to both classify a user&#x27;s season and create a list of clothes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from being an impressive project, I have a few key praises&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The members were pretty technical people, and for the most part, this was an entirely technical project.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That is, the members simply applied the analysis and methodology of experts, rather than trying to do everything themselves.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be more specific, &lt;strong&gt;the project members did not masquerade as experts in non-technical fields they have little exposure with.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All ethical concerns, such as biases in training data and use of external tools&#x2F;methods, were approached carefully. They were very keen on ensuring that this is not only a useful tool, &lt;strong&gt;but an ethically sound one too&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The team all chose to work in an area they had a deep interest in, rather than choosing something with several buzzwords just to put on a resume.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-precise-definition&quot;&gt;A Precise Definition&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrogance I describe is pretty much the antithesis of every praise I outlined above. &lt;strong&gt;It takes a certain level of arrogance to completely neglect non-technical skills and assume you can fulfill the same roles as an expert.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; That is, to assume that because you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; build a solution with technology, you can thus put an end to the problem at hand without much repercussion.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhat related is the shallow pursuit of achievements. Namely, working on a project not because of interest or skill development, but because of resume embellishment, and nothing more. In essence, &lt;strong&gt;this certain level of arrogance encompasses the negligence of skill acquisition and methodology, and focuses only on results.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; I must stress that I am not at all speaking to the intimidation or confusion many beginners feel, that is entirely separate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Important Clarification&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s important to clarify that I&#x27;m not suggesting absolute care of every detail is necessary. I frequently use technologies like &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pandas.pydata.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;pandas&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pytorch.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;PyTorch&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;numpy.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;NumPy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &amp;amp; &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-scm.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;git&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in my work. I cannot explain how they work beyond vague simplifications. And frankly, I&#x27;m not interested in improving this understanding.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I must acknowledge that I am &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; qualified at applying these technologies for specific tasks at an abstracted level, and nothing more. That is, I am not an expert in low-level design. Perhaps those skills are easy for me to acquire, but that does not make me good at them, nor does it mean I am capable of taking on a role requiring such skills.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;where-does-it-come-from-why-is-it-over-represented-in-tech&quot;&gt;Where does it come from? Why is it over-represented in tech?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The over-representation of this mindset in SDS, CS, and even math is something I&#x27;ve noticed throughout all of my undergrad. I don&#x27;t claim to understand this entirely, but I have a couple ideas.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;raising-the-bar&quot;&gt;Raising the Bar&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As any undergrad can tell you, getting into Computer Science and Data Science programs is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; competitive. You have to achieve nearly perfect marks in advanced high school courses, as well as stellar extracurriculars, to have a chance at moderately prestigious universities. As a result, anyone in such a program is going to be academically capable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combine this academic capability with the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dailynexus.com&#x2F;2024-09-06&#x2F;ucsb-awards-majority-a-grades-for-fifth-consecutive-school-year&#x2F;&quot;&gt;overall trend of grade inflation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and it suddenly makes maintaining these perfect marks within reach. Easy? Of course not. But for an academically gifted individual who already knows how to optimize grade performance, it suddenly becomes an accessible task to maintain a near-perfect record.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And well, this naturally develops such an arrogance. After all, if you&#x27;re good at nearly every class you&#x27;ve taken, surely that must mean you&#x27;re good at most things. Especially if you&#x27;re studying a field that&#x27;s used everywhere in life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet there&#x27;s a fundamental issue with this. Tech majors primarily study non-tech skills through high school, lower division, and general education coursework, which are &lt;strong&gt;introductory&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; in nature. For the most part, intro classes only offer a brief, simplified overview.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, while technology is applicable to virtually every field, that doesn&#x27;t mean a tech degree teaches you these applications. A perfect comparison is mathematics. Does being a math major make me good at all engineering and sciences? After all, math is even more ubiquitous than technology.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;difficulty-imbalance&quot;&gt;Difficulty Imbalance&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aforementioned raised bar isn&#x27;t a result of pure chance. After all, CS and SDS are known for being difficult majors, and their skills are nothing to scoff at.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, it is true, though not universally true, that the skills of a tech major are relatively more difficult to learn than the skills of other non-tech majors, particularly non-STEM fields. However, &lt;strong&gt;that doesn&#x27;t mean those other skills are trivial, or that they are easy to learn.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; For example, something like policy analysis does not have a very high barrier to entry, but becoming a skilled analyst requires years of experience that&#x27;s completely orthogonal to tech experiences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And moreover, I partially dispute the premise of this observation. While I agree that tech degrees are generally more work than non-tech, mostly non-STEM, degrees, &lt;strong&gt;they ultimately test completely different skills&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. For instance, humanities skills are much different than technology skills. It&#x27;s very much possible to be good in one and awful in the other. In fact, I would argue that a substantial amount of STEM people have awful humanities skills.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the barrier of entry for using technology becomes lower every year. Tech skills are increasingly becoming more accessible to those in other degrees, and even those without degrees.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, using technology is not at all what a tech degree prepares you for. Saying such a thing is no different from saying mathematics teaches you how to add numbers together, or that literature teaches you how to read. But this leads me directly into my broader criticism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This certain level of arrogance encompasses the negligence of skill acquisition and methodology, and focuses only on results.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth of the matter is that many of these people who neglect non-tech skills also have little regard for actually learning. Instead, the focus is to pick and choose the things that maximize results. While a tech degree teaches more than using technology, that&#x27;s effectively what these people get out of it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;demands-of-industry&quot;&gt;Demands of Industry&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To say everything above as-is, without consideration of the demands from jobs, is a gross oversimplification, and quite frankly, ignorant. As with anything, there&#x27;s another side to the story.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, the demands of industry are almost entirely applied skills. Abstract knowledge, as well as non-tech domain knowledge, often have little value in the workforce, at least for jobs below the graduate-degree level. Using, designing, and implementing technology is what defines a job in tech. I suspect that many people who fall into this arrogance simply optimize their experiences around getting a job. And well, I can&#x27;t blame them. It&#x27;s hard to not be frustrated when you are well-aware that what you study is not directly relevant to what you will work as.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the bar for a &quot;coding studies&quot; major, i.e. those whose only learning focus is to apply technology and nothing more, becomes lower each year. The barrier for implementing many technologies is not high, and is easy to independently learn online. Moreover, with the onset of LLMs, it&#x27;s easy to automate these repetitive tasks at scale.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this to say that jobs at the level of &quot;coding studies&quot; don&#x27;t require a degree to begin with. A degree offers much more. Aside from breadth in the field, it hones ingenuity through carefully approached projects and abstract knowledge. The value of projects is straightforward, and not exclusive to degrees, but the abstract knowledge has a much deeper role. It begets a profound understanding of problem-solving, offering an intuition that&#x27;s immensely valuable no matter the role. This intuition and ingenuity is incredibly difficult to replace, and is what makes many people valuable in the workforce.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I must admit my biases as a mathematician. My undergraduate degree was almost entirely abstract knowledge, and the few applications I encountered in my courses were very adjacent to theory. It&#x27;s very easy for me to overvalue abstract knowledge and undervalue everything else.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding, to say I&#x27;m judging from the sidelines is utterly wrong. It was precisely my experiences as a mentor of several applied projects that led me to these conclusions. The projects that stood out, such as DataDrip, were successful not because of their technical skills alone, but because they approached the problem with care, and respected the non-technical aspects of the problem.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, domain expertise is incredibly valuable, especially in data science. Such expertise is predominantly non-technical skills, such as scientific knowledge or humanities-adjacent skills. Overall, in my opinion, those in school studying &quot;coding studies&quot; are completely missing the point of their degree.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;final-remarks&quot;&gt;Final Remarks&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why did I write this blog? Because I&#x27;ve had this exact conversation with so many people around me. It&#x27;s gotten to a point where I feel like articulating the frustrations has some value.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To say this behavior is confined to tech majors in school is just wrong. Much of this discussion translates well into the &quot;tech bro&quot; phenomenon. &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.404media.co&#x2F;how-teas-founder-convinced-millions-of-women-to-spill-their-secrets-then-exposed-them-to-the-world&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Here&#x27;s an example from recent history&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Furthermore, I get this impression from many STEM majors, such as math and physics, though to a lesser extent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope is that someone will read this and receive clarity. Or better yet, realize the kind of path they were traveling on. After all, I was exactly like this as a freshman. But it wasn&#x27;t until my introduction to math, something I truly enjoyed, that I realized chasing dollar signs maybe isn&#x27;t a good idea.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://dtnaylor.com/writing/changing-time/">&lt;p&gt;As many people familiar with me know, I was a Boy Scout for most of my youth. I joined &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.troop609.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Troop 609&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in 2014, and was incredibly active, going on almost every single one of the outings and events. My troop was famous in Los Angeles County for being &lt;strong&gt;THEE&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; high adventure troop, and to this day, it still maintains that title.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;changing-time&#x2F;summit_to_whitney.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Approaching Mount Whitney&quot;&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, after visiting the troop following a &lt;em&gt;very long&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; hiatus, I could tell things were different. Not necessarily in a bad way, but in a way that made me realize just how long I was gone, and how much has happened since then.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-memories-of-609&quot;&gt;My memories of 609&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many people around me know that I was a Boy Scout, I haven&#x27;t talked about those experiences much, if at all. Not because I was ever ashamed of them, but because I never really felt the need to. But after seeing how different my troop was many years later, I finally understood just how much I appreciated the things I took for granted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;weekly-meetings&quot;&gt;Weekly Meetings&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the day I joined Troop 609 in 2014, until the onset of COVID-19, I was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; active in my troop. I attended almost every single weekly meeting, an event I consistently looked forward to. The meetings were a time to not only stay involved with the troop and be aware of upcoming events, but also to see my friends weekly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troops are organized into &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;troopleader.scouting.org&#x2F;general-troop-information&#x2F;troop-structure&#x2F;the-patrol&#x2F;&quot;&gt;patrols&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and during my time the troop had about 6 active patrols at any given moment, totaling approximately 50 scouts. I was a part of the Blackbird Patrol, named after &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird&quot;&gt;the plane of the same name&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;The Blackbird Patrol in 2017&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrols were a core part of our identity, as they formed the people whom we interacted with most. Moreover, they were entirely youth-led, meaning we all learned together through our successes and failures. Despite how cliquey this sounds, it never reached this point. The troop as a whole was mostly youth-led. Also, any competition among patrols was very friendly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every troop meeting, we would always devote 30 minutes–1 hour playing a game, sometimes with patrols competing. &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ultimatecampresource.com&#x2F;camp-games&#x2F;other-games&#x2F;trash-can-game&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Our favorite game was &quot;trash can&quot;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which was eventually banned by the scoutmasters for being too rough. While at first I always wanted to skip these games to cut down on the meeting length, it wasn&#x27;t until much later that I realized just how memorable they were.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked forward to these meetings greatly. It was an opportunity to not only interact with my patrol, but also everyone in the troop. Seeing about 50 peers regularly to socialize and plan events with is a unique experience, especially when you&#x27;re so young.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;outings-short-and-simple-trips&quot;&gt;Outings: Short and Simple Trips&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real joy of Boy Scouts, however, was the outings. For most troops, this meant something very simple. For example, a hike lasting around 5–10 miles, or driving to a camping ground and spending a day or two there to enjoy the scenery. We dubbed the latter &quot;car camping&quot; since we typically didn&#x27;t travel very far from the cars.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;changing-time&#x2F;running_springs.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Running Springs&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;A car camping trip at Running Springs (Jan. 2021). We came here to play in the snow and learn about survival at near-freezing temperatures.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troop 609 certainly had outings like this, and they formed the bulk of our outings. After all, they had the most broad appeal. For many scouts in my troop, these outings were the extent of their involvement. Of course, there&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with that, but in my opinion, they missed out on more exciting adventures.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;changing-time&#x2F;urban_day_hike.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Urban Day Hike&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Outdoors isn&#x27;t always nature! Every year we had an &quot;Urban Day Hike&quot; where we would hike around Los Angeles. Pictured above is the OOMO Cube in Little Tokyo.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;outings-high-adventure-treks&quot;&gt;Outings: High Adventure Treks&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far what defined Troop 609&#x27;s identity was its regularly scheduled high adventure treks. These trips often lasted 3 days minimum and were arduous. We hosted several of these trips a year, most notably during the summer and winter when all the scouts were on break.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;changing-time&#x2F;forest_hiking.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Backpacking through the forest&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Despite our fatigue, knowing that civilization is nowhere near, we inch towards our monumental goal. Part of my Mt. Whitney trip in 2019.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These trips were always my favorite, as we went to places inaccessible to most people. The sights we saw were unlike anything else. It truly is a unique experience to venture out in nature to a place mostly untouched by humans.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;changing-time&#x2F;silver_knapsack.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Silver knapsack&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Not even COVID stopped us from trekking the Silver Knapsack in June 2020!&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While backpacking constituted a majority of our treks, it certainly wasn&#x27;t the only high adventure we did. Another notable trip was canoeing 50 miles down the Colorado River, starting from Hoover Dam. A truly unique experience I&#x27;ll probably never get again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;&#x2F;images&#x2F;changing-time&#x2F;colorado_river.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Floating down the Colorado River.&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Floating down the Colorado River in August 2018. The air was hot and the water was ice cold. Felt amazing to stop and swim.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I never really appreciated until many years later was just how much endurance these adventures gave me. Backpacking, and treks in general, are &lt;ins&gt;hard&lt;&#x2F;ins&gt;. It is nothing short of miserable to feel the weight of 40 pounds of gear on your back, knowing that the destination is so far, and turning around is equally worse. But through this misery lies a purpose and a beauty. At the end of the day, I chose to go on these trips, knowing exactly how I will feel for most of it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That stress made these trips all the better. It really felt like I had to earn these sights. And well, I did. This blog displays the most exemplary pictures, but it pales in comparison to experiencing it first-hand. Not many people are able to say they&#x27;ve seen the views I&#x27;ve seen, or the experiences I&#x27;ve had. Sightseeing is one thing, but going well-out of my comfort zone to connect with nature first-hand isn&#x27;t something I can articulate in words or pictures. Also, it&#x27;s nice to disconnect from the world and take some time off for myself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-farewell-to-609&quot;&gt;My Farewell to 609&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last memory of the troop was my final meeting as a Boy Scout, occurring about a week before I turned 18. As per tradition, every Scout is asked to give a brief farewell speech before transitioning into an adult. My speech verbatim was the following&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello everybody. Some of you may know me, but to those that don&#x27;t, my name is Daniel Naylor. This is my last meeting as a youth, as my 18th birthday is rapidly approaching. I&#x27;ve been in this Troop since 2014, about 7 years, and I hope you guys will remain here until you age out. I was thinking about what I could talk about: my greatest experiences, my most fond memories, etc., but I’d like to share something else, something that I’ve learned throughout my scouting experiences: try to be as open-minded as you can be.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I mean by that? Don’t dismiss things because they’re unfamiliar. When I first joined, I hated the idea of camping and backpacking, especially for days long. Honestly, I thought it was a waste of time since I could easily access beautiful scenery within seconds on my phone. Yet, I tried them anyways, even though I was thinking to myself &quot;this is a waste of time&quot; while on the trip. It took a while and many, many trips, but I eventually broke out of that closed mindset and learned the value of camping and backpacking and, more importantly, the value of hard work and perseverance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not suggesting that camping and backpacking is for everyone, but my main point is to be open minded, and don’t dismiss things you have yet to try. Aside from that, that’s all I really have to say. Thank you all for listening, and have a great rest of your youth.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As superfluously worded as this is, I still stand by this message. But after turning 18, I pretty much dropped most of my involvement with Troop 609. After all, I was about to graduate high school, and was excited to begin new experiences in college. I was periodically involved with the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oa-scouting.org&#x2F;about&quot;&gt;Order of the Arrow&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; during my undergraduate years, but for the most part, I had left Scouting behind me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-new-609&quot;&gt;The New 609&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a week ago (9&#x2F;9&#x2F;2025), I caught wind of my troop&#x27;s semiannual award ceremony. Having not been in touch with the troop for about 4 years, I figured I&#x27;d attend and greet everyone again. After all, why not see how the troop is doing?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arrival, I cannot describe my utter shock when I saw everyone again. I knew people aged, but I never really internalized what that meant. The younger scouts I grew up with were now the older scouts. You&#x27;re telling me the troublemakers I remembered were now the people that the younger scouts look up to?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What especially broke my heart was seeing how small the troop had become. I remember the troop being massive, having 6 patrols at any given time, totaling about 50 people. However, a lot of scouts dropped out after covid. At this ceremony, there were 3 patrols and 20 scouts at best. The troop felt small. Roles like the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;troopleader.scouting.org&#x2F;general-troop-information&#x2F;troop-structure&#x2F;troop-positions&#x2F;bugler&#x2F;&quot;&gt;bugler&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; were vacant. My first impressions were that the troop is now a mere skeleton of what it used to be. What happened to all the liveliness I remember growing up with?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covid hit scouting &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Recruitment after covid never recovered to what it used to be. Many troops entirely collapsed and ceased to exist. In fact, another troop merged with 609 after their leadership effectively disappeared. While the pandemic may feel like a distancing memory, the effects of it are still felt and present, as evidenced by troop membership at an all-time low. Saddened about this, I talked to my scoutmaster, who&#x27;s been diligent all these years and still leading the troop.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these concerns, my scoutmaster assured me there&#x27;s nothing to worry about. While the troop is small, it&#x27;s still as lively as ever, just not in the same way. The frequency and attendance of events are going strong. Maybe the grandeur of going somewhere with 50 like-minded youth is a thing of the past, but the joy of the events is here to stay.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.troop609.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;troop&#x27;s website&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; after the meeting, and my scoutmaster was absolutely right. The website is covered with pictures of recent outings, from the short and simple ones to the high adventure treks. Our title of being THEE high adventure troop in Los Angeles County is as strong as I remembered it being.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m very happy that the troop managed to survive the challenges of covid. It brings me joy to know that the experiences I grew up with are no longer a thing of the past. Still, seeing the new composition of members, the new size of the troop, the vacancies in all the roles, I couldn&#x27;t help but think that the troop is approaching its endgame. As they say, all good things must come to an end.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m being dramatic and the troop only changed superficially. After all, the core values are still present and strong as ever. To say that it&#x27;s the same is just wrong, but does it need to be? Maybe this is a step in the right direction, and I&#x27;m just too stuck in the past. No matter, I&#x27;m glad 609 is here to stay for the foreseeable future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://dtnaylor.com/writing/adjusted-score-notes/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction-of-the-problem&quot;&gt;Introduction of the Problem&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 2023–2025, I was a board member for &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datascienceucsb.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Data Science UCSB&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. A major event we host is our annual &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datascienceucsb.org&#x2F;projects&quot;&gt;Project Showcase&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, where club members present their projects in front of judges, comprised of industry experts, professors, PhD students, etc. Judges are asked to score each project, and we combine their scores via a simple sum to determine a final ranking, using this to distribute cash prizes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when we computed the final ranking for Project Showcase 2024, we were incredibly disappointed. Not because we believed the winners didn&#x27;t deserve to win, but because the scores seemed completely arbitrary. The top 5 projects were all within 1–2 points from each other, out of about 60 points total.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon closer inspection, we realized what the problem was. Many judges gave essentially the same score to all projects, particularly higher scores. In other words, many judges exhibited a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;positivity bias&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Since all judges are weighted equally, this causes the value of an individual point to rise dramatically.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could argue that this is not inherently problematic. After all, the projects we select as finalists are going to be the better projects in our (very large) club, so it&#x27;s natural to expect that they are all well-received by judges. Hence, the positivity bias is simply reflecting a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;survivorship bias&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; that we the officers create.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is a plausible explanation, we felt that the issue runs deeper. Out of 60 points, a point gap of about 5-10 among the top performers is to be expected. However, when 1st and 2nd place are only 1 point off from each other, when 2nd and 3rd place are 1–2 points off from each other, and so forth, it&#x27;s difficult to conclude anything other than statistical noise.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, I have heard this exact same problem articulated in many other clubs and judging panels. Thus, I feel justified in saying that there is a problem to be solved that isn&#x27;t a result of the innate survivorship bias with our structure. The point of this blog is to detail, and justify, the solutions I arrived at.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;preliminary-definitions&quot;&gt;Preliminary Definitions&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I can begin articulating my solutions, I must lay out definitions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;toy-data&quot;&gt;Toy Data&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For illustrating examples, we will use the anonymized raw scores for &lt;strong&gt;Project Showcase 2025&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Judges were asked to score projects in 5 separate categories on a range from 1 to 9. Hence, the range of a judge&#x27;s raw score is 5–45.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;CSVTable&quot; style=&quot;overflow-x: auto;&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.jquery.com&#x2F;jquery-3.6.4.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;script&gt;  
&lt;script src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;storage.googleapis.com&#x2F;google-code-archive-downloads&#x2F;v2&#x2F;code.google.com&#x2F;jquerycsvtotable&#x2F;jquery.csvToTable.js&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
$(function() {
  $(&#x27;#CSVTable&#x27;).CSVToTable(&#x27;&#x2F;misc&#x2F;adjusted-score&#x2F;toy_judge_data.csv&#x27;);
});
&lt;&#x2F;script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As can be immediately seen, &lt;strong&gt;Judge Delta&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&#x27;s scores range from 40 to 45. In other words, they gave every project near-perfect scores. Similar behavior exists across other judges, albeit with notable outliers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mathematical-definitions&quot;&gt;Mathematical Definitions&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use the index $i$ to refer to projects, and the index $j$ to refer to judges. First, we define the terms&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$M$: Number of projects&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$N$: Number of judges&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$p_{ij}$: The raw score of project $i$ from judge $j$.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my original notes, the $p$ stood for &quot;points&quot;, and I may use &quot;points&quot; to describe &quot;scores&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the raw score data can be thought of as the matrix $P = (p_{ij})$&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To introduce more formal terminology&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition: Scoring Method&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;scoring method&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is a function $\rho: \mathbb{R}^{M \times N} \to \mathbb{R}^{M}$. The component $\rho_i$ is called the &lt;strong&gt;final score&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; of project $i$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, a scoring method takes raw scores as input, such as the toy data above, and outputs a final score to each project. The standard we used, the &lt;strong&gt;Raw Sum&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, was simply
$$
\begin{equation}
\rho_i = \sum_{j=1}^{N} p_{ij}
\end{equation}
$$
While two methods may not always produce the same scores, they may be equal in one crucial way&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
 &lt;!----&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition: Equivalent in Ranking&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define $(k)_{ \vec{v} }$ as the index of the $k$th largest component of the vector $\vec{v}$, i.e. the index of the $k$th &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Order_statistic&quot;&gt;order statistic&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, in descending order.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say two scoring methods, $\rho$ and $\varrho$, are &lt;strong&gt;equivalent in ranking&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; if, for every input $P$, $(k)_{\rho(P)} = (k)_{\varrho(P)}$ for every $1 \leq k \leq M$.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a complicated way of saying that both methods always produce the same ranking, even if they don&#x27;t produce the same final scores. For example, (1) is equivalent in ranking to the average judge score, i.e.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\varrho_i = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} p_{ij}
$$
For our purposes, we consider two scoring methods as essentially the same if they are equivalent in ranking.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on Equivalent in Ranking&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two details worth mentioning&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The precise definition of $(k)_{ \vec{v} }$ is intentionally avoided. Without proper care, it may not even be well-defined! What happens in the event of a tie?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In practice, a tiebreaker is defined. We do not concern ourselves with such details, and simply assume it is a part of the definition of $(k)_{ \vec{v} }$&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, equivalent in ranking forms an &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Equivalence_relation&quot;&gt;equivalence relation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Importance of the Raw Data Generating Process&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article exclusively talks about methods that produce final scores. However, in no way do I endorse any of these ideas as a panacea.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a reasonable system that evaluates projects and translates judge&#x27;s opinions into numbers&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is just as, if not more, important than a system that adjusts those numbers into final scores. As they say in machine learning, &quot;garbage in, garbage out&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we outline the methods I&#x27;ve thought about and proposed. Note that each has its own assumptions, with its own benefits and tradeoffs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a baseline, here are the final scores using (1) as the scoring method&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table 1: Raw Sum Final Scores&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Finalists&lt;&#x2F;th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Raw Sum&lt;&#x2F;th&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;&lt;&#x2F;thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 1&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;406&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 4&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;379&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 2&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;377&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 6&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;374&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 8&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;354&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 3&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;352&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 7&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;328&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 5&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;320&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;tbody&gt;&lt;&#x2F;table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These scores have a range of 50–450. As we can see, the data identifies Project 1 as a very clear winner, far surpassing all those below it. Between Projects 2, 4, and 6 though, the effect of the statistical noise becomes much more clear.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many of these methods, we will require the following two definitions from statistics&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\mu_j$: Judge $j$&#x27;s raw score &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arithmetic_mean&quot;&gt;average&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\sigma_j$: Judge $j$&#x27;s raw score &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Standard_deviation&quot;&gt;standard deviation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unless otherwise stated, we treat the data as a &lt;strong&gt;sample&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; instead of a &lt;strong&gt;population&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. In those cases, we include &lt;em&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bessel%27s_correction&quot;&gt;Bessel&#x27;s correction&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rather simple method that makes one fairly mild assumption.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The score data for each judge represents a complete population, not a sample.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;

This is analogous to the methodology of standardized testing. It&#x27;s customary to treat standardized test scores as a population, not a sample. We need this assumption for the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Standard_score&quot;&gt;$z$-score&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to be well-defined, otherwise we are in truth defining a &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;T-statistic&quot;&gt;$t$-statistic&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $z$-score of $p_{ij}$ is defined as&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
z_{ij} = \frac{p_{ij} - \mu_j}{\sigma_j}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, we treat each raw score as a part of a population of judge $j$&#x27;s scores, and transform them into $z$-scores. We therefore define the adjusted score as&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\begin{equation}
\rho_{i}^{z\textrm{-score}} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} z_{ij}
\end{equation}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying this transformation to our toy data, we get the ranking&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table 2: $z$-score Sum Final Scores&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Finalist&lt;&#x2F;th&gt;&lt;th&gt;$z$-score Sum&lt;&#x2F;th&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;&lt;&#x2F;thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 1&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11.702&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 4&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5.429&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 2&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.329&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 6&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.328&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 3&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;-2.235&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 8&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;-2.419&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 7&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;-9.711&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 5&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;-11.422&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;tbody&gt;&lt;&#x2F;table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, this gives us what we wanted. Namely, an unambiguous first place, and a fairly clear second place. Third and fourth place are incredibly close though, and suffers the same problem I outlined in the intro (winning due to statistical noise). However, there&#x27;s more than meets the eye&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By definition, $z$-scores are &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dimensionless_quantity&quot;&gt;dimensionless&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, therefore the final score is dimensionless. There are two conflicting interpretations of this:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On one hand, the final score being dimensionless makes it an objective quantity.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the other hand, we are effectively interpreting it as a score, which is contentious as it does not have the same units.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interestingly, this is almost identical to the ranking of scoring method (1). However, note that Project 3 and Project 8 switched places.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike Raw Sum score, this has a (theoretically) infinite range. Without prior knowledge of $\{\mu_j\}_{j=1}^{N}, \{\sigma_j\} _{j=1}^{N}$, pinning down the range is incredibly difficult.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since we are &lt;strong&gt;DIVIDING&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; by standard deviation, we are actually &lt;em&gt;uplifting&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; the positivity bias. Judge Delta&#x27;s points are now the most valuable points since they contain the least variability.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last point is what caused us to reject using this method in Data Science UCSB events. After all, one of our goals was to &lt;em&gt;eliminate&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; positivity bias, not enhance it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;proportional-variance&quot;&gt;Proportional Variance&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partially inspired by the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statology.org&#x2F;explained-variance&#x2F;&quot;&gt;explained variance&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; metric, the Proportional Variance score seeks to weigh scores based on how much variability each judge introduces.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our metric to be well-defined, we need the following assumptions

  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judges whose individual points are most informative, hence possesses the least statistical noise, use a wider spectrum of the scores.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

      question
    &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumption: Judge Independence&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;All judges choose their scores independently.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;

By independent, we mean the random variables representing each judge&#x27;s scores are all &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Independence_(probability_theory)#More_than_two_random_variables&quot;&gt;mutually independent&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. We can interpret each random variable, $S_j$, as &quot;Judge $j$&#x27;s outcomes for Project Showcase 2025&quot;. There&#x27;s certainly more nuance than this, however to avoid being pedantic, we&#x27;ll sweep those details under the rug.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want independence to ensure that there is no &quot;overlapping signal&quot; across judges. That is, each judge represents their own opinions and nothing more. Thus, $\frac{\mathrm{Var}(S_j)}{\sum_{k=1}^{N} \mathrm{Var}(S_k)}$ quantifies how much variability judge $j$ introduces in relation to all other judges.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, define $\omega_j = \frac{\sigma_{j}^2}{\sum_{k=1}^{N} \sigma_{k}^2}$. Because of the prior analysis, there is validity behind interpreting $\omega_j$ as judge $j$&#x27;s introduced variability.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We define the &lt;strong&gt;Proportional Variance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; score as
$$
\begin{equation}
\rho_{i}^{\mathrm{PV}} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} \omega_j p_{ij}
\end{equation}
$$
It&#x27;s important to note that the similarities to explained variance are nominal. While the formula is similar, it is much different fundamentally.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying this method to our scores, we get the following ranking&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table 3: Proportional Variance Final Scores&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Finalist&lt;&#x2F;th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Prop. Variance&lt;&#x2F;th&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;&lt;&#x2F;thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 1&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;40.683&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 2&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;37.518&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 4&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;36.785&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 6&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;36.523&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 8&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;35.113&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 3&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;33.726&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 7&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;32.102&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Project 5&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;30.559&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;tbody&gt;&lt;&#x2F;table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit of this scoring method is it preserves the range, as well as the units, of the raw data. In this example, the range is 5–45, and the units are points.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it reduces the tightness of the scores. If we multiply everything by 10 to bring the range to 50–450, we see that second and third place are off by about 8 points, whereas with the Raw Sum method, they&#x27;re off by 2 points (see &lt;em&gt;Table 1&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As before though, there&#x27;s more that meets the eye&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying that independence justifies the interpretation of $\omega_j$ &lt;em&gt;is&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; a bit fallacious. Rather, it&#x27;s more appropriate to say independence &lt;em&gt;inspires&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; this interpretation.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also argue that, being an estimator, this approximates the truth pretty well. After all, it&#x27;s common practice in statistics to replace quantities with estimators. However, this is merely acknowledging an abuse and not justifying it.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The assumption of independence is contentious. In this example, we have that $\sum_{k=1}^{N} \mathrm{Var}(S_k) \approx 163.571$, yet $\mathrm{Var}(\sum_{k=1}^{N} S_k) \approx 810.5$
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One can argue that, if we drop the denominator in $\omega_j$, we obtain a new score method that&#x27;s equivalent in ranking to Proportional Variance. Thus, we can drop the assumption of independence while keeping an essentially identical system.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, this messes up both the range and the units. Is it okay to judge a project with units of $\mathrm{points}^3$?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, see $\kappa$-adjusted score for a similar approach&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In fact, independence is unnecessarily strong&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; for the interpretation of $\frac{\mathrm{Var}(S_j)}{\sum_{k=1}^{N} \mathrm{Var}(S_k)}$ as introduced variability. &lt;strong&gt;Uncorrelated is sufficient&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, as this ensures $\mathrm{Var}(\sum_{k=1}^{N} S_k) = \sum_{k=1}^{N} \mathrm{Var}(S_k)$, hence $\frac{\mathrm{Var}(S_j)}{\mathrm{Var}(\sum_{k=1}^{N} S_k)} = \frac{\mathrm{Var}(S_j)}{\sum_{k=1}^{N} \mathrm{Var}(S_k)}$
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the cost of a modification, we can drop the assumption altogether. Using &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Principal_component_analysis&quot;&gt;Principal Component Analysis&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we can linearly transform the random vector $(S_1, \dots, S_N)$ into $(\hat{S}_1, \dots, \hat{S}_N)$ such that $\hat{S}_i, \hat{S}_j$ are uncorrelated for every $i \neq j$. To obtain a ranking, we apply Proportional Variance on the new dataset induced by $(\hat{S}_1, \dots, \hat{S}_N)$.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are essentially transforming the judges into a new, idealized set of judges with uncorrelated opinions. &lt;em&gt;Is this an ethical thing to do?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing this in code is incredibly simple. Note that all of this is equivalent to performing a change of basis on $P$ before computing its final scores. This is equivalent to finding $\rho^{\mathrm{PV}} (PC)$ where $C$ is the matrix of $P$&#x27;s principal components.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This method is pretty susceptible to outliers. One deviating score can drastically inflate the variance of a judge.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We see this behavior with &lt;strong&gt;Judge Foxtrot&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. All scores are within 5 points of 35, except one 44 entry.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As promising and reasonable Proportional Variance seems, it nonetheless has its problems.

    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caution: Ramifications of New Approach&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In point 2 above, I outline a process that drops the assumption of independence altogether by weakening it to zero correlation, then showing that all score data can be manipulated to achieve zero correlation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be very careful with this approach&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Aside from the ethical concerns of replacing the judges with idealized versions of themselves, this is ultimately manipulating the data to fit a very specific metric (i.e. uncorrelated). Is this level of preprocessing necessary? If yes, why is the solution to change the raw data and not its generating process?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These criticisms may apply to all the other methods (e.g. &quot;How is adjusting scores not fitting a specific goal?&quot;). The point of this blog is to address them as best I can. I do not renounce this approach as fundamentally wrong, but &lt;strong&gt;I implore anyone attempting it to offer more justification than I have.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;kappa-adjusted-score&quot;&gt;$\kappa$-adjusted Score&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is ultimately the scoring method we settled on for use in Data Science UCSB&#x27;s events. The development of this came from modifying the $z$-score Sum method to simultaneously down-weigh positivity bias while also maintaining units of points.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we proceed, we must make two crucial assumptions
 &lt;!----&gt;


&lt;div

      question
    &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumption: Purely Average Score&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;All judges have a score which they would consistently give to any idealized average project. This &quot;purely average score&quot; is unique to each judge.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;

The existence of an &quot;idealized average project&quot; is dubious, but we set those details aside. The reason for this assumption is so we can explain why judges use different parts of the score spectrum. Suddenly, we can now say that one person&#x27;s 7&#x2F;10 may be someone else&#x27;s 5&#x2F;10.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use $\mu_j$ as a stand-in for this &quot;purely average score&quot;. This is objectionable for our toy dataset, since the judges were evaluating finalists, not all projects in the club, thus $\mu_j$ is a biased estimate (recall: survivorship bias).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I acknowledge this concern, and an easy fix is to slightly modify the assumption to &quot;Purely Average Score among Top Performers&quot;, or &quot;Purely Decent Score&quot;. Note that this implicitly assumes some finalists are below this threshold. In our opinion, we felt that this assumption was equally reasonable for our events.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

      question
    &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumption: Judge Variability&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judges whose individual points are most informative, hence possesses the least statistical noise, use a wider spectrum of the scores.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Proportional Variance, we will use standard deviation to weigh points. Unlike Proportional Variance, we include a hyperparameter to tune the strength of this weighting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let $\kappa &amp;gt; -1$. The $\kappa$-adjusted score is defined as
$$
\rho_{i}^{\kappa\textrm{-adj}} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} \mathrm{sign}(p_{ij} - \mu_j) \left (\sigma_j^\kappa \left| p_{ij} - \mu_j \right| \right)^{\frac{1}{1 + \kappa}}
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this definition is complicated, it&#x27;s straightforward to unpack. Treating $\mu_j$ as the &quot;purely average score&quot;, $|p_{ij} - \mu_j|$ captures how many points away a project is from &quot;purely average&quot;. We then weigh this by $\sigma_{j}^{\kappa}$ in order to uplift judges with more variability. Finally, we root by $1 + \kappa$ to ensure the final units are the same as the raw data&#x27;s. The purpose of the $\mathrm{sign}$ term is to simply avoid issues where we may root a negative number.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there&#x27;s more to the role of $\kappa$ than meets the eye. By design, it&#x27;s intended to quantify how much weight $\sigma_j$ has. Higher $\kappa$ means the weights are larger. However, note that we effectively weigh the score by $\sigma_{j}^{\frac{\kappa}{1 + \kappa}}$, which means that the exponent is always less than 1. Perhaps not the precise desired behavior, but the desired behavior nonetheless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More interestingly, this method makes point gains non-linear.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\kappa \in (0, \infty)$: We see that $\left| p_{ij} - \mu_j \right|^\frac{1}{1 + \kappa}$ behaves like a root function, meaning increasing $p_{ij}$ from $\mu_j$ → $\mu_j + 1$ has more of an increase than $\mu_j + 5$ → $\mu_j + 6$.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\kappa = 0$: This is linear, and in fact equivalent in ranking to (1).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\kappa \in (-1, 0)$: We see that $\left| p_{ij} - \mu_j \right|^\frac{1}{1 + \kappa}$ behaves like a polynomial, meaning increasing $p_{ij}$ from $\mu_j + 5$ → $\mu_j + 6$ has more of an increase than $\mu_j$ → $\mu_j + 1$.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly, while $\kappa &amp;lt; -1$ is &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; defined, it is not interpretable. We would run into a situation where scores close to $\mu_j$ are more valuable than scores far greater than $\mu_j$.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that $\mu_j, \sigma_j$ changes if $p_{ij}$ changes. This analysis, while accurate for the most part, is oversimplified. Only small increments to points should be considered.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying this method to our toy data yields&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;tbody&gt;&lt;&#x2F;table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with everything else, there are deeper criticisms&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like the $z$-score Sum, it&#x27;s difficult to figure out the range without knowing $\kappa, \{\mu_j\}_{j=1}^{N}, \{\sigma_j\} _{j=1}^{N}$.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&#x27;s difficult to choose a good value of $\kappa$. For Data Science UCSB events, we stuck with $\kappa = 1$ and increased if we felt the resulting final scores were too large. This approach suffers the same criticisms as &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Empirical_Bayes_method&quot;&gt;empirical Bayes methods&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The premise of this criticism is rather presumptuous, as choosing $\kappa$ is effectively choosing the scoring method. What defines a &quot;good&quot; scoring method?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still, is there any nuance or cleverness here, or is the choice arbitrary?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Out of all methods, this one is the most numerically unstable
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Especially for raw scores with large ranges.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though not as susceptible to outliers as Proportional Variance since $\sigma_j$ is rooted.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Interesting Modification&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
  &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;pl-4&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we effectively weigh by $\sigma_{j}^{\frac{\kappa}{1 + \kappa}}$, the weights are going to be smaller than $\sigma_j$. It&#x27;s quite strange that $\kappa$ has this effect.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivated from the definition of the $L^p$ norms, let&#x27;s instead define
$$
\varrho_{i}^{\kappa\textrm{-adj}} = \left| \sum_{j=1}^{N} \sigma_{j}^\kappa \left(p_{ij} - \mu_j \right) \right|^{\frac{1}{1 + \kappa}} \mathrm{sign}\left( \sum_{j=1}^{N} \sigma_j^\kappa \left( p_{ij} - \mu_j \right) \right)
$$&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does $\varrho^{\kappa\textrm{-adj}}$ share the same units as the raw data, the effects of $\kappa$ are much more straightforward.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this loses the effect of non-linear point gains, and moreover $\mu_j$ can be dropped without affecting the ranking. Be aware of these changes if you decide to go with this modification.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, in spite of these criticisms, we were the most satisfied with this scoring method. We felt that it not only down-weighted the positivity bias present in many judges, but also filtered out noise very well. We also saw the non-linear point gains as a benefit.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While evaluating these scoring methods is rather tricky, and may even lead to a situation akin to &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Data_dredging&quot;&gt;$p$-hacking&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, it&#x27;s nonetheless useful to have a number of tools at your disposal. The heuristics we mainly used in Data Science UCSB was&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do we feel like the new gaps between scores changed in a positive and significant manner?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will the judges, participants, and audience accept the new ranking?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do we have a legitimate reason for adjusting the judge&#x27;s assessments?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do we plan on releasing the scores, and if not, do we need to worry about participants that are well-below the winners?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, many of these criteria are vague and imprecise. We only ended up using this system twice. Still, we felt like it gives us more peace-of-mind knowing that the winners were chosen more &quot;fairly&quot; and less &quot;arbitrarily&quot;. Whatever that means.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;code&quot;&gt;Code&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
