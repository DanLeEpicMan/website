Hello! As you may have guessed, my name is Daniel T. Naylor. I am currently a PhD student in [Statistics at UC Irvine](https://www.stat.uci.edu/). My interests include data science, Bayesian statistics, and statistical modeling.

I completed my undergraduate studies at the [College of Creative Studies](https://ccs.ucsb.edu/) at UC Santa Barbara, with a major in mathematics and a minor in statistical science. During my later two years, I served as an officer for [Data Science UCSB](https://www.datascienceucsb.org/), where I attribute many of my technical and professional skills.

Outside of school, [I am a very avid gamer](https://steamcommunity.com/id/danleepicman/). I have played a wide variety of video games, from narrative-driven visual novels to competitive multiplayer shooters. Currently, I have an enormous backlog of single-player games, sitting at over 300 titles. This very well could take a decade to finish, even if I pursued it professionally.

Additionally, I enjoy connecting with nature. I am an [Eagle Scout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Scout), and I additionally hold the [Vigil Honor](https://oa-scouting.org/program/awards/vigil-honor). My most proud high adventure trek was summiting [Mount Whitney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Whitney), the highest point in the contiguous United States! It took us about 7 days, and it was gorgeous!

And lastly, I really enjoy talking to people. I have a very bad habit of giving unsolicited advice or telling stories unprompted. Feel free to reach out to me if you don't mind! All my socials can be found on my home page.
